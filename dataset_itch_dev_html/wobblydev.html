It is a goal of mine to organize my fellow workers in the games industry who suffer terribly in the current cycle of development and crunch culture.<br><br>I make a lot of art—or at least I try to. I write books, I draw comics, I make video games, I write and perform music. I enjoy it all.<br><br>The peculiar thing about art, is that there's no pay in it. Anthropologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>David Graeber</strong></a> writes about peculiar phenomena in the landscape of our economic system. For example, there is a counter-intuitive thread running through our society that says the more you enjoy what you do, the less you are entitled to "earn." It's as though the benefit of not hating your life justifies poverty.<br><br>That's weird, isn't it?<br><br>It validates only the most grueling, tedious, crushing jobs while devaluing labor that creates culture, or caring, or joy. It's worth noting that this system also dangerously undervalues labor that infuses measurable goodness into our society, while rewarding (grotesquely) work that literally harms people and the world at large <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/more-valuable-your-work-society-less-youll-paid-david-graeber" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>[source]</strong></a>.<br><br>Why am I bringing this up? That's a great question! I don't know. I'm still trying to figure that out.<br><br>In the meantime, I'll make art and see what happens. Thanks for visiting 😺</p>
