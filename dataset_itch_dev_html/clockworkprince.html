My pronouns are they/them/their/themself.<br></p>
<p>I love making narrative-driven games, though tend to use implicit storytelling for most of my projects so far. Gameplay-wise I tend to focus on exploration and puzzles, though some games might also have some action elements. <br></p>

<p><strong>Q: I want to play your game, but they are all marked as Windows only and I am on Linux/Mac. Can I still play them? </strong><br>A: My games have been created and tested on Windows only, so I cannot guarantee you can play my games on a different OS. However, you can try using one of the following software to make them work for you: </p>
<p>Wine: <a href="https://www.winehq.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.winehq.org/</a><br>EasyRPG: <a href="https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/Player" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/Player</a><br>RPGHub: <a href="https://rpgmaker.net/games/7635/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://rpgmaker.net/games/7635/</a></p>
<p><strong>Q: I found a monetised referral link for one of your games. What should I do? </strong><br>A: Please do not send hate to the person who put the monetised referral link to my game, but contact me instead so I can ask them to take down the link. <br></p>

<p><strong>Q: Can I make a fangame of your games? </strong> <br>A: This depends on the game. You'll have to consult the disclosed file about fanworks to see if it is allowed for the particular game you want to make a fangame of. If making fangames is allowed, please stick to the fanworks rules as outlined above, along with the following additional rules:</p>
<ul><li>Only non-commercial fangames are allowed. (Patreon, PayPal donations, etc. are exempt, as long as they are not required before acquiring the product.)</li><li>Please mark all fangames clearly and explicitly as being unofficial. </li><li>Please do not port my games over to different engines without prior permission. (This means no remakes in e.g. Unity or GameMaker.)</li></ul>
