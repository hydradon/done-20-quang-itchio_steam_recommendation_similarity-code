I've always felt that Steam's various attempts at recommendation systems have missed something, either in the thematic content or the mood of the games. For example, a person may enjoy Rocket League because they like futuristic rocket cars, or because they like team ball-games. An algorithm might decide that because they like Rocket League, they ought to like FIFA or Madden, when acutally Wipeout might be a better recommendation, or vice versa. Another example: I don't normally like 3rd person 3D platformers, but because I've played Life is Strange and Chrono Trigger, maybe I'd appreciate Prince of Persia: Sands of Time as a recommendation, because it features time travel. However, if I mostly enjoyed those two games because I enjoyed complex, branching stories, I would appreciate the Prince of Persia recommendation.  I suppose what I am getting at is that an algorithm needs to not just try to draw similarities between games, but to analyse a players' library and habits and attempt to understand the connections between what they like and what they don't.

However, they aren't thematically, narratively or mechanically similar. The gameplay and story are too widely different to consider the match to be relevant.","I think this is a great idea, and I'd love to see an AI driven recommendation system for itch.io.  I've always felt that Steam's various attempts at recommendation systems have missed something, either in the thematic content or the mood of the games. For example, a person may enjoy Rocket League because they like futuristic rocket cars, or because they like team ball-games. An algorithm might decide that because they like Rocket League, they ought to like FIFA or Madden, when acutally Wipeout might be a better recommendation, or vice versa. Another example: I don't normally like 3rd person 3D platformers, but because I've played Life is Strange and Chrono Trigger, maybe I'd appreciate Prince of Persia: Sands of Time as a recommendation, because it features time travel. However, if I mostly enjoyed those two games because I enjoyed complex, branching stories, I would appreciate the Prince of Persia recommendation.  I suppose what I am getting at is that an algorithm needs to not just try to draw similarities between games, but to analyse a players' library and habits and attempt to understand the connections between what they like and what they don't.

My assumption here is that it's based on tags and I assume that ""arcade"" and ""action"" are bringing out all of these, while Carrie's Order Up is more of a traditional top-down arcade experience. I think a better fit would be something like ""PAC-MAN™ CHAMPIONSHIP EDITION"", which I know isn't a AAA game, but it might be worth expanding the field of known games to any of them that are widely popular. You might also want to throw in some 2D pixel-based games, as Carrie's art style is like that and I could see some players being interested in games with that style? Like someone that played Shovel Knight might want to check out other retro-inspired games.  As a side note; Carrie's Order Up is on Steam as well. I figure you're keeping the scope to itch.io recommendations but it might be worth bringing it to people's attention if a game on itch.io is also on the Steam platform, as some people do prefer some of the features Steam offers.","mJmiHuwgVUtjo0IRQx34324cEnoiGRI5","2020-07-03 03:37:46","0.143951","3702"

The only real similarity is shooting, but FPS isn't that comparable to a twin stick shooter like Beacon. ","Overall the list of games we were given were not very similar to Beacon's twin stick shooting and roguelike structure. A few of the games would be good comparisons if the player enjoyed the art style or theme of the world, and for other games maybe generally players that like shooters would be interested. The Multiplayer games presented though were generally poor comparisons and I don't think suggesting our top down single player shooter would lead to much interaction from players of those games.

","Thank you very much for choosing our game, Of Blood and Shadows, to be part of this study! The idea behind your investigation is very useful and I believe it will improve by a lot the discoverability of indie games. I think developing a well structured search-engine would vastly expand the audience of indie games. It was a very interesting study! If I may offer some feedback regarding it: 1) It was a little bit difficult deciding on how to rate some games, because judging by just the cover and the description was not informative enough in order to build an opinion on whether the games were similar to ours or not. The most important information that was lacking sometimes from most descriptions was:  -Whether a game is a VN (visual novel), a 2D platformer, an RPG, an FPS, an MMO, etc -Whether the genre was horror, adventure, romance, action, mystery, drama, etc. So I think adding the type and the genre of a game as keywords or tags underneath the covers would be very useful! 2) I found the thumbs up/thumbs down systema bit too restrictive, as sometimes I found myself wanting to rate something inbetween. I wish I had four options, like ""similar"" ""slightly similar"" ""not very relevant"" ""non-relevant"". An example I can provide: A game is the same style as ours (i.e. a Visual Novel type game), but the genre is horror, which is not very close to ours (mostly being action and a bit of romance).  So maybe the player would like to try out other Visual Novel games because they like those types of games, but they do not enjoy horror. So rating such a game as similar to our or not is difficult. Therefore I think the distinction between game-type, and genre is very important. One player might love horror games and not care whether they are in VN, or FPS, or RPG type.

The idea behind your investigation is very useful and I believe it will improve by a lot the discoverability of indie games. I think developing a well structured search-engine would vastly expand the audience of indie games. It was a very interesting study! If I may offer some feedback regarding it: 1) It was a little bit difficult deciding on how to rate some games, because judging by just the cover and the description was not informative enough in order to build an opinion on whether the games were similar to ours or not. The most important information that was lacking sometimes from most descriptions was:  -Whether a game is a VN (visual novel), a 2D platformer, an RPG, an FPS, an MMO, etc -Whether the genre was horror, adventure, romance, action, mystery, drama, etc. So I think adding the type and the genre of a game as keywords or tags underneath the covers would be very useful! 2) I found the thumbs up/thumbs down systema bit too restrictive, as sometimes I found myself wanting to rate something inbetween. I wish I had four options, like ""similar"" ""slightly similar"" ""not very relevant"" ""non-relevant"". An example I can provide: A game is the same style as ours (i.e. a Visual Novel type game), but the genre is horror, which is not very close to ours (mostly being action and a bit of romance).  So maybe the player would like to try out other Visual Novel games because they like those types of games, but they do not enjoy horror. So rating such a game as similar to our or not is difficult. Therefore I think the distinction between game-type, and genre is very important. One player might love horror games and not care whether they are in VN, or FPS, or RPG type. And on the other hand, another player might only like 3D-RPGs and not care whether the genre is romance based, adventure, or horror.","8RnKl9ygYumPhfonsW6sixPpBCo6pNvL","2020-06-28 20:08:41","0.0648159","10673"
