"(Also check out the  GameJolt page )  Capsule Guy is a challenging platforming game where you shoot lasers at things and win sometimes.  Made mostly by myself ( @1f1n1ty_ ) in four months as a capstone project for a year-long independent study in game development. Although it's not a stunning game, for a larger scale project than all my previous endeavors, I'm really happy with how this turned out and by extension the direction of my game creating passion! At least I think that's how it works  As this is an academic project, I don't want to compel anyone to spend money to play it, but I encourage you to donate if you feel so inclined! It would mean a lot to me. You can make a one-time donation directly on this page or go to  my Patreon  to support all of my work. If you can't, though, spreading the word is fine with me :)  Anyway, hope you enjoy!  Features, to an extent:  Laser shooting, which is an unoriginal yet oddly charming concept 30 handcrafted levels, so that the frustration you get from the difficulty is completely intentional 5 enemy types, which is a new world record and breaks several boundaries 4 original songs (downloadable on  my Bandcamp  for everyone interested, and for everyone not interested) A minimalist art style, which in this case is just a lazy cop-out for not being an artist Some secrets to find, but without any in-game consequences that would otherwise distract from the actual secret  Credits, abridged:  Matthew Zhang - Developer Brandon Barber - Mentor More credits in the game  Important notes:  Controls: Keyboard + Mouse. Seriously these levels are designed for mouse and without one it's very hard. Aspect Ratio: 16x9 fullscreen highly recommended. Platforms: Windows + MacOS. Linux users, I apologize.

"Concept This game was realised during the first edition of ""La Grande Confiture de Jeux"" (the Great Game Jam) organized throughout France. The objective was to create a game in 48h with the following theme: ""Throne"". We realised for this occasion a game named Kings Maker. It's a small strategy game where you play a throne maker. The goal is to acquire lot of fame by selling thrones to kings/queens and also manipulate them… Indeed, a throne will influence the evolution of its ruler and therefore his or her kingdom. The game is a little bit complex to understand, so i recommend you to read the tips in the top left part of the screen (and tooltips on the differents element of the game).

"Now crowdfunding on Fig !  Description 	Jazon and the Dead is a style-rich, blood-splashed, top-down, action-adventure game that mixes brain-twisting puzzles with an engaging narrative, dark humor and a hip 80's vibe. The game's stark comic book visuals set this game apart from others in the genre. 	Jazon and the Dead is heavily inspired by old horror and B-movies (Night of the Living Dead and Braindead), with visuals influenced by comic book artists such as Mike Mignola, Charlie Adlard and Frank Miller. 	As the game starts, Jazon wakes up disoriented in the restroom of a bar and he doesn't remember a thing. As he leaves the bar, he finds a ruined world ruled by zombies and scumbags. 	As Jazon travels across the wasteland, he must discover his past to save the future. Along the way he meets Zoey, a wasteland veteran who just wants to forget about her history. Together they visit the oracle in the mountains, who foresees a prophecy leading them on an epic odyssey to save humanity from complete annihilation. 	Tim Schafer - President & CEO, Double Fine 	 ""What if Full Throttle had zombies and was made in Denmark?""  	Brian Fargo  - President & CEO, InXile Entertainment 	 ""Nice visual style guys.... looking good.""  	Javy Gwaltney - Game Informer 	 ""The game's gorgeous visuals do a good job of making it stand out""  	Jacob Wood - IndieHangover 	 ""With a B-movie vibe and fantastic graphic novel style aesthetic, Jazon and the Dead looks incredibly polished.""  Game Features 	 Player-driven story where you must weigh the consequences of your choices. The story is divided into acts, each with bridging cinematic scenes that focus on different aspects of human nature. 	 Fight your way through hordes of zombies with a heavy gun or bloody fist. Ammunition is scarce so you need to make every shot count! Dash and push zombies out of your way to survive through close combat. 	 Explore a world inspired by 80's sci-fi B-movies with chunky old technology and lots of blood and gore. Your journey takes you through deserts, abandoned towns, underground caves, surviving cities and military facilities. 	 Puzzle your way out of tense situations before the slow, brain devouring creatures reach you. Work cleverly with corpses in the world -- as weights or to stand on to reach your destination. 	 Groovy 80's inspired soundtrack.

"This game is in early development! Please read the entire page before purchase!   Follow us on  Twitter ,  Facebook , and on  Discord  for development updates!  Sovereign Tea  is a Turn-Based Strategy RPG for desktop platforms with a simple premise: Tea VS Coffee. Play as the  Tea Princesses  and brew loyal  Tea Minions  to combat the wicked forces of the ever-growing  Coffee Empire !  This game is still early in development. If you have feedback or suggestions, please  reach out to us  to share your thoughts. We at  3 Halves Games  always appreciate constructive criticism and feedback!   The  Coffee Empire  is growing by the minute, conquering lands that once belonged to the now-splintered  Tea Realm . Despite their fundamental differences, the sovereigns of the land, the  Tea Princesses , agree to work together to stave off the impending threat and save their collective homeland.   Sovereign Tea  is a tile-based strategy game with emphasis on resource gathering and management. The  Tea Princesses  serve as your commanders in the fight against the  Coffee Empire . By collecting resources on the map, you can brew a variety of  Tea Minions  that are contextually useful. Do you brew a fast but weak scout and use them to cultivate more resources on the map, or a slow but strong warrior to fend off the invading forces? With each map limited in its agricultural yields, it is up to you to experiment and adapt your overall strategy. Beware, however, as the  Coffee Empire  is capable of the exact same thing.   All units you can make have actions and abilities. Actions are relatively simple: Attack, Move, Heal, and so on. What makes the combat in this game unique are the abilities that fire at different phases of combat. Some units have abilities that fire when they die, when they hit an enemy, when they get hit by an enemy, and more. Finding the unique interactions and combos possible with this system is your way to victory.  Even more, each  Tea Princess  grants her brewed minions a unique ability that differs by princess, further augmenting how you create your army and how you approach the enemy forces.    Each  Tea Realm  in the game is ruled over by a  Tea Princess . The  Tea Princesses  are commander units with the ability to transform cultivated resources into  Tea Minions . In their fight against the  Coffee Empire , they have formed four unique alliances:   Herbal Teas White Teas Green Teas Black Teas  Each alliance is composed of three different  Tea Princesses . In game, these alliances have their own unique story arcs where they must overcome adversity in order to fend off attacks from different  Coffee Regents . With four teams of three princesses, there are a total of twelve different playable  Tea Princesses .      We look forward to sharing more information on each and every one of them in the coming months!   We're taking a different approach when it comes to pricing our game: we're scaling the price up as development progresses based on significant milestone. If you're an early adopter who happens to purchase this game before full release, you will gain early access and receive updates as they come. We want to be completely transparent with when we increase the price of our game and we hope the below graphic summarizes our intent well:     If you buy the game early, please take note that you are buying an  in-development  title. Do not expect a full game until the final milestone is met in Q4 2020. As always, should you purchase early please offer us any and all feedback! Your early support will help us craft  Sovereign Tea  into a truly great title.  You can offer feedback by  joining our Discord . If you purchased the game here, upon proof of purchase, we will award you with a unique  Savior of the Arts  role in our server!   As seen above in the Pricing Model section, we have different milestones we aim to reach in the development of this game. We'd like to detail what each entails:  Version 0.1   (Q4 2019) An extremely early look at the game. One map to play with three units to brew. Showcasing of basic combat and resource gathering systems with early trigger callbacks. Little to no animation or polish. Windows only. Alpha Release   (Q1 2020) Real playable levels showcasing alliance mechanics where you control multiple  Tea Princesses  at once. Enemy AI making early, but meaningful strategic decisions against you. More units to brew and resources to harvest. Increase in number of actions present in the game. Early Access   (Q2 2020) Multiple levels that can be played across all four alliances. Multiple animations in place. Further fleshed out gameplay mechanics and polish. Full Game Release   (Q4 2020) The full game with all campaigns and levels. Music and sound effects finalized. Everything finalized... It's the release, after all!  As development proceeds we will update this page with additional information. Beyond that, we will more regularly post updates on our social media platforms, so be sure to connect with us to stay in the loop. Follow us on  Twitter ,  Facebook , and on  Discord  for updates!

"Pitch Black Serenade demo is available and free to download!  January 1st, 2009. A truck crashes in the middle of Shibuya, Tokyo. Kairi Nakajo wakes up in a hospital with total amnesia. Soon after, his parents break to him the news that they have decided to move to the tranquil city of Kujikawa. Kairi is forced to go with them, basically cutting off every direct link to his past.  Three years have passed, but therapy has failed and Kairi has not managed to get any of his memories back. In the meantime, he has grown suspicious of his parents, who appear to have been trying to replace his missing memories with new ones. The new memories seem to have been carefully chosen in order to mold a new Kairi, who would more closely resemble their ideal son.  Tokyo has changed as well: thick clouds are covering its sky and a dreadful case of serial abductions threatens its residents. And it appears that it all started on the day of Kairi's fateful accident...   ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦♦♦♦♦♦♦  Features.  ♦ Genre:  Romance / Paranormal / Coming-of-age / Mainly aimed at girls. ♦  Shape Kairi's personality .

"1991, the 22’nd of May, at the break of dawn, a family is awoken by the shrill screams of a woman. The family gathers at their bedroom window as they eye the empty streets outside to find the source of the commotion. The street is slick with mildew, and nothing is moving. As they are about to give up and head back to bed the doors to the apartment building across the streets slam open. A woman, terrified, exhausted exits the two massive front doors and collapses in the middle of the concrete path. The family, startled, draws their drapes shut and calls the police.  The affair is handled quietly. The authorities say it was a domestic affair, nothing more. The land- lord shortly evacuates all tenants living on the third floor and has reportedly bared shut apartment number 3906. No one is allowed to set foot on the third floor, even more so: Apartment 3906.

CHOOSE BETWEEN STORY MODE OR PUZZLE MODE to experience  Blue Lacuna  the way you like best. By award-winning interactive story author Aaron A. Reed ( Ice-Bound ,  18 Cadence ,  Almost Goodbye ,  Prom Week ) Quotes ""If the creators of Zork or Witness had a copy of Blue Lacuna travel back in time and appear on their computers,  they would have wept openly ."" -- G4 TV ""...one of those rare experiences that turn your set of assumptions about a medium on its head. ... as close to 'interactive literature' as I've ever seen in gaming ."" -- Jay Is Games ""There is no separation between the way the player engages in narrative and the way he engages in gameplay. There are no cut scenes, no uninteractive passages, no portions where the characters are essentially 'switched off' and indifferent to what the player does. Everything counts.

"— from the Greek sarx meaning “flesh”, and phagein meaning “to eat”.  Sarcophagus is a one-man game project in the sandbox/survival genre. It’s heavily inspired by the works of Sisyphus and the idea of the ennobling power of labor. You start your lifespan in a shallow environment of (an allegory of) the cave and slowly work your way to a blooming garden by building and maintaining the cave’s ecosystem.  The game is deceptively empty at first, but make to mistake - you can populate it all by yourself.  By no means it’s a god sim, food always will be a problem (you must grow what you eat) and you’ll have to face some other human-specific limitations like an overwhelming urge to multitask, a pain of managing priorities, limited inventory space, absence of game’s wiki and author’s inability to communicate in good English.  The game is more on hardcore’ish/demanding/oldskool side of a spectrum and requires some exploration, learning and adjusting to its quirks.  It’s not a clone of anything, the purpose of creating the game was not an imitation of things I like but rather playing in a sandbox and looking at the ways things unfold. Sandbox game created as a sandbox project. So meta.  How to play:                               Get Ice Shards. Knowledge is power. Inspect everything you can.

"Story  The scene takes place in an area somewhere in England in the 1920’s. You wake up from a bed in a big house, without any idea who you are and where you are. Perhaps someone lives there. Your condition is bad, and therefore it could be nice with some friendly faces willing to help you out. You will quickly discover that’s not the case.   How to play    As you progress you will find some interesting objects. Some objects are collectable and some are useable. The crosshair turns green, if you look at objects of interest.  The inventory    The items you have collected, will appear in your inventory. Some items has a HAND icon. This is for using the item on yourself, like equipping. A MAGNIFYING GLASS icon appears on items with deeper information, for example a book to read. As for using items on useable objects, simply drag the item from the inventory onto the object. As you hover over the current item in your inventory, a tooltip will describe the item.  The journal    Throughout the game, you will come across several events. Therefore, you will have a journal to keep track of these events.  Puzzles  In the game there are some puzzles. Most of them are important, because they will unlock your progression.    Some puzzles do have some clues, which helps you to solve them. Controls  Movement: ASWD    Sprint: Shift    Crouch: C  Interact: E    Inventory: I  Light: F    Journal: J   Map: M  Menu / Close: Escape  Game in development    This game is a early access version. The game is completable. However, you will come across several items and objects which aren’t really necessary, for completing the game.   The full game will contain more areas, like a, forest, church, crypt and more.

"A game by Winston Powell and Alexander Bascom   Sprout is all about exploration discovery and experimentation. Much like it's  predecessor , it encourages you to play with all the elements you come across to create new life that will inhibit the large open environment. The landscape is filled with many mysterious locations and ancient ruins to discover, much of which hold secrets to be uncovered as you progress. As new life finds its way to the world, more can be learned about the strange beings that once lived there!  Much of the game is yet to be created so this demo features simple exploration and the flora and fauna will be added in as we progress.  Controls  ""WASD"" to move around ""Shift"" to move around faster ""Esc"" will close the game",,3D||Colorful||Exploration||Fantasy||First-Person||nature||Open World||Singleplayer||sprout||Unity,Sprout,acornbringer.itch.io/sprout

"Based on a true story.  Adam - Lost Memories is a psychological horror game, based on a true story that happened to me when I was a child.  Fear in real life is not from zombies that want to eat your brain, or the ghost that came back from the after-life to open your fridge while you slept.  True fear is when you cry in the corner of your small room for some food and water. True fear is when you are constantly shamed, terrorized, and humiliated for years. True fear is when you can't see the end of it.   I created this game because I wanted to show people how it feels to be a child who grew up in a family that's falling apart.  Back then, the only thing I had was a book. When I read it again and again, it would sometimes feel like I was inside it, in a different place. For me, that was an escape from reality.   This game builds up an unforgettable and unique atmosphere from the beginning. This is not a walking simulator, and this game does not rely on jump-scares. You play as a mentally ill person who suffers from panic disorders.  You play as me...   Features:  - An Immersive first person experience. - A physics based world, where you can interact with every object. - Puzzles that you can solve in different ways. - A completely narrated main story, by the professional voice actor Isaak Wells. - 3D sound implementation for the best experience. - Original music made by me. - A true, original story that will change the way you see child abuse.  If my game can gain enough support, I'm definitely going to help children who have a life like mine was, because this game is about them too.    Articles - Reviews:  Rely on Horror ""one of the most striking horror games I’ve seen this year.""  Indie Game Website ""it’s a horror game about being afraid of life""     Currently the game contains roughly a two hour long playtime. The full version will be a 5 - 6 hour single player campaign.

Like a tourist, it seems there is no place for her, and it's hard to make friends when you are only passing through.	   	One day, her teacher assigns the class a project, based on one simple question: ""What is the true spirit of Amorina?"" It's a simple question indeed, but it feels impossible for an eternal tourist like Cello. Luckily, a pair of classmates comes to her rescue.

"Explore the shifting and spectral city of Helheim, in this procedurally generated Norse afterlife. Hel can be played as an atmospheric walking sim set in a grim and eerie underworld, or you can try to discover the mysteries of Helheim and find a secret mechanic to escape to a better afterlife. The question is, does a better fate make you a better person? Hel is powered by Unreal Engine 4 and can be played using keyboard and mouse, or 360 pad. In Norse mythology, Hel was the name of both the goddess and the place that she ruled over. When a human died, they could end up in one of three places to dwell until the end of the world. People who had a noble death, either went to Valhalla or to Fólkvangr. Those whose lives and deaths were dishonourable, pitiful, or even just unremarkable, travelled to Helheim. Thus Hel was the afterlife for people who died of disease or frailty. In other words, it was for the wives and mothers, the elderly, infants and disabled people, just as much as it was for cravens and criminals. Was that fair? Maybe not, but the afterlife is what you make of it.",,Atmospheric||Exploration||First-Person||hell||Horror||mythology||Procedural Generation||secrets||Unreal Engine||Walking simulator,Hel,aethericgames.itch.io/hel

"The sun sets down on the avenues of Yumeshima, as you and your friend jump on your motorbikes and start the engine. You spot a small group of punks screwing around in an alley. It is time to show them who is the real owner of theses streets.      In  Aichi Emperors Zero  you embody two members of and old biker gang,  battling to death to repeal  the young hooligans who invaded your city. Riding your bike through the city of Yumeshima, you will have to  help each other to defeat the punks . On your journey, you will face  deadly challenges . But in the end,  the city will be yours!   DISTRICTS  Your goal is to  claim back your territory  by capturing each of the three districts handled by the punks:  Atsuta , the northern area and its temple,  Kobaya , the modern neighbourhood, dominated by the shiba tower, and finally  Shinisho  the business district, and his overwhelming skyline. Gradually taking back Yumeshima will prove your worth as samurai to the disrespectful punks.   BOSS  However,  you will have to face one last challenge before claiming the city as yours.  As you take a hold of the third district, the  leader of the punks  will appear. Bigger and stronger than the average enemy, the boss can create a mystical energy shield,  that you have to break as a team , using a deadly combo attack :  The Emperor’s Blast !   DRIFT  By braking and turning at the same time, you will be able to drift.  The more you skid, the stronger the boost at the end of the drift . Learn to time your actions, as the game really lives up to its full potential once  you have perfectly mastered your bike and your environment.    NITRO  Driving around, you leave a glowy trail behind you for your friend.  Following the trail, he will accumulate nitro,  allowing him to catch up on you at full speed. But you can also  gather some on your own by destroying props, doing epic jumps and passing near walls.  Nitro is a helpful and versatile tool that can help you find your teammate, escape the punks or destroy them.  Don’t forget to use it!   RAM  As modern day samurais,  you can use your bikes as much as your weapons to battle your opponents . Enemies tend to follow around, so lure them into crashing by driving close to walls or obstacles. In a more aggressive way, ramming an enemy at full speed with the nitro will also grant you a nice explosive kill.   KICK - PUSH  To defend yourself from the punks, use  the kick: a light attack  that can be performed by  pushing the right hand stick on the left or right . Much like nitro, it can be used in both  a defensive, and an offensive way  : either by repelling enemies or by throwing them into walls, which will definitely kill them.  KICK - INTERRUPTION  The kick can also interrupt enemy attacks. When a punk tries to attack you, a flashing symbol appears above his head.  If you kick him right before he hits, he will be immediately thrown off his bike to get a taste of the concrete below.  EMPEROR’S BLAST  The Emperor’s Blast is  a cooperative super attack  that unleashes mystical powers upon your enemies. Its principle is quite straightforward: upon reaching your teammate, you can charge you emperor’s blast by pushing the right stick up.  The more you charge it, the more nitro it consumes.  When you release the stick,  you rush to your buddy and trigger the mighty Emperor’s Blast.

Enemies and vfx can have a heavy impact on performances. If the framerate drops below a certain threshold, to avoid bigger issues we freeze the game physics. Sorry for this inconvenience.  📝 INFOS  Aichi Emperors Zero was developed during 9 months as a graduation project at Supinfogame Rubika, France.  Please note that this game will be not published nor developed further. You can expect small patches to fix some of the issues and maybe optimization, but no big features like online multiplayer, bigger map or anything like that. The development team is now split and everyone is focused on their internships and future career. If you want to support us, the best way to do so is to share this game on social media. This would be awesome and we would be very grateful!  🛠️ INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS  Unzip the file Read the manual to know more about the game Read the readme for known issues Launch 'AICHI.exe'  Two controllers have to be plugged in and be assigned controller 1 and 2.  🏍️ ENJOY!

"PLAY THE FAITH: CHAPTER III DEMO  HERE!     FAITH is a pixel horror game inspired by the era of MS-DOS, Apple II, Atari, and ZX Spectrum classics.    ""A truly eerie horror game."" -  IGN  ""Aside from being well-drawn, this is a well-paced, well-written, tense and fairly scary horror game."" -  PC Gamer  ""A remarkable game."" -  Rock Paper Shotgun  ""FAITH puts a fresh spin on spiritual horror"" -  Rely On Horror  ""It may appear simple, but Faith hides some incredible scares"" -  IndieGames.com  ""Incredibly freaky"" -  Free Game Planet  ""In the case of FAITH, less is more."" -  Paste Magazine   On September 21, 1986, two priests arrived at the Martin Family home in rural Connecticut to investigate an apparent case of demonic possession. Only two people would leave the house alive.  Haunted by nightmares and searching for answers, a young priest travels down a dark highway to return to the cursed house a year later.     Forget blue-and-pink neon. The 1980s were scary. No Internet, it was hard to reach you if you weren't home, and the U.S. was engrossed in the “Satanic Scare” which fueled widespread paranoia about devil-worshiping, witchcraft, and occult practices.   What gamers are saying about FAITH: "" ...I find this spookier than a game with much better graphics and effects"" ""Amazing how something so minimally designed can be terrifying"" ""This is so f***ing horrifying"" ""Well, I didn't want to sleep anyway"" ""I'm gonna s***t myself""  FAITH takes about 1 to 2 hours to complete 100%. It is recommended that you play it with an Xbox 360 controller.  WINDOWS 8 USERS :  FAITH  is known to have game-breaking graphics issues for Windows 8 users with onboard Intel HD graphics cards like the Intel HD Graphics 4000.

Everybody who lives in Arcadea has a special arcade machine they can visit in their dreams that lets them fulfill their strongest wishes. Whether it’s to go on an adventure, or make friends, or fall in love, or solve a mystery, or completely start a new life, there’s a game made just for them...         By playing these arcade machines, you can find out a lot about a person…their aspirations and their goals for example. Oh and also their regrets, their insecurities, and their biggest mistakes. Huh...video games can’t be that deep right? Must be a bug or something.

"(press any key on the title screen to start the game)  Sleep Walker  was made for  Game Maker's Toolkit Jam 2018 ! The theme was [genre] without [mechanic]. So we made a platforming game in which the character doing all the platforming isn't controlled by the player. Instead, you control a separate character, shooting things that help get the platforming character to the end of the level. In this sense it's also technically a top-down shooter without vertical scrolling, but it's mainly about the platforming!

WARNING:  THIS GAME AIMS TO AT TIMES CREATE A PURPOSEFULLY UPSETTING ENVIRONMENT FOR THE PLAYER, AND CONTAINS CONTENT SUCH AS MENTION OF SELF-HARM, SUICIDAL, AND SELF-DEPRECATING THOUGHTS. VIEWER DISCRETION IS STRONGLY ADVISED. PLEASE STAY SAFE. IF THE PLAYER WISHES TO AVOID SUCH CONTENT, THEY CAN DO SO BY SIMPLY AVOIDING MOVING TOWARDS ANY OF THE RED COLORED OBJECTS IN THE GAME,  AND SKIPPING THROUGH THE ONE NON-OPTIONAL DIALOGUE TOWARDS THE END OF THE RED SECTION.   THE GAME DOES HAVE A HAPPY ENDING  once the player has made it back to a white-colored area after the red section.

DESCRIPTION:  discomfort zone is a 2D pixel-art narrative game about depression, anxiety disorder, despair, and recovery. The game takes a realistic, un-filtered, and at times uncomfortably personal look at depression and anxiety disorder through the eyes of someone dealing with these conditions, promoting understanding and sharing the experience with a wider audience. The game deals with many themes related to depression and anxiety: worry, loneliness, and self-deprecating thoughts, but also hope and finding the strength, when all seems lost, to keep going. Made in a heavily-hacked version of the Bitsy engine, the game uses a simple art style, limited color palette, and basic controls to ensure accessibility.   CREDITS:  Made in Bitsy:  https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy  Utilizes some Bitsy hacks by Sean LeBlanc ( https://github.com/seleb )  The game's design, additional code & hacks, writing, & art are all by me.

"Startup Panic is a simulation game about creating a startup. We choose to build it for two reasons: the first reason is that we like a simulation game. The second is that we live our daily life as a software startup. We know a bit more about startup than the average people, and we believe that we can put our experience into the game and make it more immersive.  In Startup Panic, a player will first work from their bedroom, later on, he/she could move to a bigger office and hire more employees. Here are some of the features in this demo: 1. Create a feature for your startup 2. Make a decision in startup daily life 3. Hire an employee 4. Manage employee's mood and motivation 5. Deal with competitor 6. and many more.

"COMING SOON: THE AMBER SKULL AND THE GOLDEN DESERT  Triforce  is a short puzzle game by Patrick LeMieux ( alt254 ) and Stephanie Boluk ( chouxsalad ) inspired by paradoxical places from the original  Legend of Zelda.  In  The Legend of Zelda,  there are several strange spaces hidden around Hyrule that defy the logic of the Cartesian grid: the Lost Woods, the Lost Hills, and the Lost Roads. When navigating these 2D mazes, Link finds himself endlessly looping, temporarily arrested by a classic gaming trope. But when visualized in 3D, these labyrinths start to look different.  Triforce  features a non-Euclidean Hyrule full of donuts, Möbius strips, and Klein bottles as well as other secrets folded within the topologies of Zelda. Can you navigate three new dungeons in three dimensions to discover the three pieces of the triforce?  Triforce  is a free game, designed for educational purposes and originally published in 2017 as part of  Metagaming,  a book by Stephanie Boluk and Patrick LeMieux available open access at  manifold.umn.edu/projects/metagaming . Graphics, music, sound and text from The Legend of Zelda are property of Nintendo.  Reviews ""Nintendo has used spatial tricks before, like the flat walls of  Super Mario Odyssey , the 2D/3D switching of  Super Paper Mario  or quick minigames in  WarioWare: Twisted! , but  Triforce  takes it a step further to something that really needs to be played to do it justice."" —Heather Alexandra,  Kotaku  NES Remix "" took classic NES titles and reimagined how people played them. It was a great success, but after watching the trailer . . . for  Triforce,  I realize there are so many more interesting ways to reimagine classic games than just replacing Mario with Link."" —CJ Andriessen,  Destructoid  ""The Topologies of Zelda: Triforce  is a head melting non-euclidean puzzle adventure in which you attempt to collect three Triforce pieces while traversing a  The Legend of Zelda ’s inspired 2D world that’s mapped onto rotatable 3D structures."" — Free Game Planet  Awards ""100 Best Free Indie Games of All Time"" — Indie Game Website ""Weirdest Video Games of 2018"" —David Wildgoose,  Junkee ""Best Video Essays of 2018"" —Shane Denson,  BFI  Updates Updated 11/18/18 11:00PM PST to fix lag/hanging issues on Windows!!

"SIGN UP FOR HOVERGREASE ALPHA 6  HoverGrease mixes the feeling of traditional first-person shooters with fast-paced arcade-like characters via top-down game mechanics.  HoverGrease takes place in a biologically advanced dystopian cyberpunk future where humans altered with animal DNA are the new trend.   At the end of the 22nd century, advancements in bioengineering allows to cure almost any terminal disease through mix-and-match of genes from any living creatures with human DNA. The procedure is mostly used as a last result, as most of the time it results in abnormalities and disfigurations. On a few rare occasions, the altering of DNA has yielded some highly desired results, where the balance of human DNA with genes from a single animal resulted in aesthetically pleasing specimens — some even attractive / good looking creatures. These lucky ones have become overnight sensations living a life of public attention — nicknamed Anthro Influencers. Little does the public know about the reality of their contracts with Big Corp Inc., the world's leading company in DNA altering, who claims to have full control over the results. Big Corp Inc. is looking to change the public perceptions of DNA altering by sponsoring an Anthro-only tournament as a PR stunt, and you are invited to join!  Play as Kimmy Frog, Johnny Cockhead, Foxy BonBon, Lab-Rat Perry or as Piggy Smith (the first 5 Anthro Influencers revealed out of the 12 character roster) and blast your way to freedom!

Also           called the Sun King for his luxurious tastes and extravagant           appearances, he is           driven by the belief that the sun – his sun – should shine           upon all peoples of           the world. His enemies are as numerous as the stars but it is           the moon that           reigns the night. Poisoned and left for dead, Louis’s bastard  son emerges           from the smoke and ashes of Germany’s battlefields under the           guise of the Moon           King. Hatred festering in his heart, he has employed the aid           of diabolical and           forbidden sciences to build an army the likes of which the           world had not seen           since the days of Lucifer’s rebellion.         Now the dead           rise from their mass graves,           seeking vengeance upon the king that demanded their deaths           while he basked in           glory. Can you, the Sun King’s bravest musketeer, stop the           approaching eclipse           before it swallows the sun?   About  Development on the game began in January of 2018. The feature we worked the longest on is the musket. There was hardly a precedent from other games for a similar mechanic, so we could not simply take an existing mechanic and put our own spin on it. Instead it was necessary to dive into and really understand the 17th century in order to transform the historical rules of early gunpowder weapons into a viable gameplay mechanic for a 2D action platformer. We spent a lot of time visiting museums and poring over books in order to make the game as authentic as we could.  The goal of this demo is to conduct an early test of the core gameplay features, which are now considered complete, and to get feedback on these as we are ramping up production of the remaining game content. For the final game we want to feature many more enemies, locations and boss battles.   Rules  The core gameplay revolves around timing actions, such as attacks and jumps, in order to prevail in combat and survive the relentless onslaught.  It is important to understand enemy patterns in order to exploit their behavior. Taking advantage of enemies causing friendly fire is the key to success.  The Moon King's army is not composed of conventional soldiers; these are the living dead, and simply killing them once is not enough to guarantee their surrender.  There is only one antidote against the cancer of undeath: gunpowder and shot. Landing the killing blow with your musket will tear apart the body and make further resurrection impossible. Keep in mind that you can also shoot corpses before they revive.  Blighted Hearts, in their current implementation, are not final yet. Currently they act as an additional layer of health, with the added risk that gaining a second Blighted Heart will immediately kill you. The intent is to expand this mechanic and allow for alternative level routes and additional content that is unlocked by having these instead.

"In the summer of 2019 a massive worldwide meteor shower covered the Earth hitting every major continent. The meteors did little damage but for the following two weeks the sky was covered in a thin haze. When the haze cleared a massive alien ship could be seen hovering over the Atlantic Ocean near the European coast. It was so large it could be seen for hundreds of miles just hovering there, motionless in the sky for 8 months. Never moving. Never making contact.  	Finally in February 2020 it happened. They attacked.  	The meteor shower turned out to be a ploy to get their ground troops in position around the world. The alien intruders struck swiftly and without mercy. Less than 1% of the population escaped the planet to a space station built in secret for such an occasion.  	It is now 2025. With 5 long years waiting and over 90% of the population lost, we are finally able to mount an attack in an attempt to RECLAIM EARTH.

It was originally created in 2017 as a personal challenge to build a game from scratch in less than a week. The game was completed in a few days, then abandoned in favor of other projects.  Much later, I was looking through my old projects and decided, since Burglary was essentially finished, I might as well release it online for free. So I made some minor tweaks, added an alternate ending, fixed a couple of bugs, and packaged it up.  It's a very short, flawed game.

"Depersonalize Me is a game about  depersonalization  which makes me feel like the world isn't real and everything is strange. I tried to capture how my anxiety activates it and how it's hard, but not impossible, to recover when it happens.  The light, positive thoughts will disappear on their own. When they spawn they reduce the anxiety level. The dark, negative thoughts don't go away on their own and must manually be thrown in the trash. They increase the anxiety level just by being around. The recycle bin can be used to temporarily remove thoughts and they'll come back after a few seconds. Unity's WebGL games can't use the audio mixer so the sound effects aren't the same. For the best version of the game download and play the .exe locally. If you have anxiety or depersonalization I'd love to know what you think of this! Feel free to reach out to me too!

Third , it's not your average pixelated adventure game. Its story, sounds and music are designed and engineered to make the game stand on its own. 	 Fourth , this game actually enhances your mind. Its meaning maybe is one of the deepest you'll ever find in any interactive experience you'll ever play. Keep playing to understand what does it mean.  	Now some hints on the  plot . Or not. 	Well, let's say that even a tiny hint about the story will be a huge  spoiler  on its emotional impact. 	I'll leave here some  screenshots  to satisfy your curiosity. Beware : the screenshots' chronological order is jumbled up (on purpose) and they represent only a small bit of the game's events. You don't want to get any spoiler from the screenshots? Watch them eyes closed. It's easy. Look. Like this.  	Ok, we've  finished  (with  bold  too). 	It's time to play.  	Oh, are you still reading? Maybe you want to know more about this game. 	All right, here you have some cold technical information.  	Minimum system requirements: 	-O.S.: Windows® 98/ME/2000/XP/Vista/7/8/8.1/10 	-CPU: Pentium® III 800 MHz or higher 	-Screen resolution: 800x600 	-Free hdd space: 100mb 	-Free ram space: 128mb 	-GPU memory: 32mb 	-DirectX®: DirectX® 8.0 or higher   One last thing (and sorry for the bold, but it's a really important thing to me): Making games requires time. And despite Einstein's theories, time is money. Since I'm giving you my time for free, I'm also giving you my money for free. If you're feeling lucky, good. It's because you are. So, I would really appreciate if you consider a donation tip when downloading this game. Just to even things up a bit.  Thank you.

"Damascus current  Not what you expect...  "" Damascus current "" is a game about charged flows and shifting realities.  You'll encounter stories with unique choices and derivative moments where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.   Instructions  Remember : the best way to approach this game is being completely unaware of what it's all about. Understanding how to play is also part of the experience. However, here are some basic guidelines on how to make progress:  Your choices direct the current flow until you acquire the "" FLOW SEAL ""; When things don't go the way they should've gone, you can reset the current flow by using the "" DAMASCUS CURRENT ""; Once you've acquired a ""FLOW SEAL"", "" SHIFT "" the current flow to the right to enter the next one (or to the left to visit a previous one).  The game automatically saves your progress and position. If you need to start from a "" new game "" status, just use the "" DAMASCUS CURRENT "" on each flow in which you've already acquired a seal, and "" SHIFT "" back to the first flow.   "" Damascus current "" contains suggestive and psychologically disturbing themes. Player discretion towards such themes is strongly advised. Adult, horror, surreal, tense, and violent elements are also occasionally presented throughout the whole experience.  One more thing: do not adjust your set, the jittering is intentional.

"In Memory of the Eternity  Discovering darkness  There are many stories in this game. Some of them are sad, some funny. Some of them are stories of madness, of violence. Some are ordinary.

"Our Place  A surreal exploration of haunted minds  In ""Our Place"" you'll be experiencing memories and emotions belonging to deeply haunted minds. Anything in ""Our Place"" has a reason to be there: colors, objects, sounds, symbols, or even the number of pixels on screen.  The best way to enjoy this journey is through short sessions. Once in a while, remember to take a walk, think about what you just saw/heard/read, and (maybe) do some research about it to clear up your thoughts or to dispel your doubts. When you'll be ready to get back at it, you'll find that your position has been automatically saved to let your exploration continue from where you left it earlier.  In ""Our Place"" there's absolutely no ""goal-reaching"" rush. Nevertheless, a way to track your progress is available on the always accessible help screen.

"***Attention Buyers: Queen At Arms: Deluxe Edition is now on sale on Steam!!  http://store.steampowered.com/app/362020/   As well as DRM-free on itch.io!!  https://aqualuftgames.itch.io/queen-at-arms-deluxe-edition  *** Queen at Arms is a fantasy visual novel from Aqualuft Games. As a young girl, Marcus Cordale was rescued from a violent political coup and taken away from the country of her birth. To protect her identity, she was raised as a boy. When she comes of age, she joins the army of Orthera, in search of her elder brother. But when war breaks out, the Ortheran army is thrown into turmoil, and the young recruit is catapulted through the ranks. Can she step up to lead, and wage a battle against the kingdom she called home?   A story of political intrigue, love, and war:  Navigate a world rife with political intrigue, bloodshed, and uncertainty as a young soldier still seeking her place in the world. Form strong bonds with others to survive.   Every choice counts:  Player agency is everything, and you can act as you please. But be aware—each time you make a decision, it has the potential to affect everything from battle outcomes to your relationships with other characters. And you may lose a friend or two before the war is over!   Prepare for battle:  Before major battle sequences, the player has the opportunity to hone many different skills, including swordplay, medicine, and magic. What you take the time to learn can make all the difference in a future skirmish!    Relationships with others:  The player's relationships with NPCs are more than just dry statistics—each character has a story to tell and secrets to uncover. Acting in a certain way towards one person may jeopardize or strengthen your relationship with another.   Complex themes:  The story tackles matters of gender identity and diverse sexualities, and features the potential for relationships with characters both male and female, in a culture where standing out can at times be dangerous. What is a visual novel? A visual novel is very much like a choose-your-own-adventure book, presented as a multimedia experience. Make tough decisions in order to advance the plot and stay alive, and watch the story unfold with all original art and sound. Features Over  ten  hours  of gameplay with nearly a dozen endings    Potential friendships or romances with  seven  different characters Quick, action-packed combat sequences with timed decisions    Sprawling battles with complex strategic choices System Requirements Queen at Arms is built on Ren'py, a Python-based engine, and is available for  Mac, Windows, and Linux  operating systems.

But in a town where magic is lurking just below the surface, can Eddie make it work — or will the more human side of life hold him back again?

Cornelius  is a maybe-probably-actually-magic genius with a photographic memory and enough generalized anxiety for six upset Pomeranians.  Davis 's pride and joy is his endless collection of comic, anime, and game merch, but his taste in friends and figurines are both equally questionable.   Louis  loves art, gardening, and dreaming about the unrealistic alternate reality where he can get more than three hours of peaceful sleep a night.

He seems very out of place among the rough, unrefined types who hang around San Fran's seedy parts, though there's a good reason for the company he keeps.   Wild, impulsive, bloodthirsty, and Dominic's polar opposite, Rex wears his vampiric nature like a badge of pride. It's a wonder he's lived as long as he has, considering his reckless nature and insatiable appetite.

Requiescence is a  gothic fantasy BL visual novel  set in an arcane, mysterious cathedral. It chronicles the story of a young mage, Kymil, as he adventures into the cathedral's dark depths in an attempt to unravel the mystery behind his uncle's death. Along the way, he meets a host of powerful adventurers, all with their own personal goals... and secrets.   The full game features:  125,000 words (10+ hours playing time) 23 CGs 3 different romance routes Partial English voice acting 13-track OST PG-13 and R-18 versions 6 endings Steam + Itch.IO DRM-Free Key s  Free demo available below! (Approx 2-3 hours playtime)   What's a visual novel?  A visual novel is a game with little traditional ""gameplay."" The player reads text on the screen, accompanied by visuals and audio, and follows through a set story. However, they can make choices to determine the story's route and the ending. Think of it as a choose-your-own-adventure book, except in a game (and with art and sound!).  What's a BL game?  A BL game is a boy's love game - a game that focuses on a relationship between two males.   Which version should I get?  On this page you will find both the full releases of the game and the demo version, which is free. We also have support for Windows, Mac, and Linux -- just download the appropriate version for your system. Also, please note the rating of the version you download.  Why did we make this game?  A lot of our inspiration comes from the popular Nitro+CHiRAL games (namely, Togainu no Chi and Lamento: Beyond the Void), as well as a fantastic doujinshi VN, Cage -Open-. We wanted to present the BL visual novel community with our own take on the genre, and we aim to create an experience that will be unlike any other.   How does the itch.io version work?  On the purchases/download page of the game, you will have the ability to download every version available (PC/Mac/Linux, PG-13/R-18). You will also have the ability to redeem a Steam key.  Screenshot:  http://i.imgur.com/dQ8pHZL.png    How does the Steam version work?  The Steam game is the PG-13 version of Requiescence. Every Steam purchase includes an itch.io key so that you have access to the DRM-free R-18 version as well.   Windows: Right click the game in your Steam library. Select ""View CD Key"".

"Arena is a Deathmatch Simulator Game  That is the motto of Arena I came up with in 2018 February when the game has seen its release. I have made a promise to keep pushing out free updates on a regular basis, which then started taking place weekly - on every Tuesday. Not missing a single deadline, Arena has received 25 updates since the release at the time of writing and I have no intentions to stop. :)    This Game is Chaotic and That is a Compliment  Arena is a matchmaking-sandbox with four major variables: guns, mutators, game modes and achievements. Furthermore there are options for game pacing, maps and randomization, but I cannot afford to pay the writer to talk about those.  Arena has your everyday handguns, shotguns and assault rifles to play it safe, but then something broke and camouflaged smugglers started flooding the game with blowtorches, fireworks, magical Moonswords and shurikens that can execute shadow steps. Not that the regular guns are boring - revolver-whirlwind is actually a thing and the engineers made sure to arm assault rifles with grenades too.   Mutators - if the term does not ring a bell, think Big Head, or Low Gravity - minor settings that change something about the match. You can have as many of these turned on as you want! Their name really says what they do - further examples are Dual Shoot and Rapid Fire. With tons of different combinations, they do make every play unique.  Admittedly, game modes are not the strongest point of Arena right now as it only features Deathmatch and Last Man Standing. However, you can play both in teams instead of the no-mercy free-for-all mode. I have plans for 3 more game modes (again, at the time of writing - this number may rapidly go up), including one which is a survival-PvM crossover.  Finally, Arena has achievements to help players set goals. No, there are no ""kill 1000 bots"" or ""win 100 matches"" achievements. Those require intensive grinding and are boring. Achievements are all unique, require some thinking, experimenting with the game settings or just keeping an eye open for secrets. Some tell you what to do straight away while some are more cryptic. Gotta get them all!  This is where the importance of updates kick in - every update adds something new, usually falling into one of these four categories. That is something to look forward to every week. :)    Arena is not Flawless  As much as I would like Arena to succeed, this section is dedicated to some ups and downs of the game.  - The game sessions are rather short, but with all the possible combinations of matches Arena has great replayability.  - The graphics are rather simple pixel arts, but there is a fancy CRT effect for your retro needs.  - The game is single-player only (although that is to change), but you are going be blown away by the slow-motion, double-jumps and rocket-jumping.  - Arena is a small indie game, but only for now. I have plans for large updates (you may check my blog to learn about these).    Also Available in Binary  Arena has been developed in C without any game engines and thus the application is fast and lightweight - requires only 10 MB of disk space, is portable and should perform good on all systems.  Support for OpenGL 2+ is required.  The current builds are for 64-bit Windows but I am more than happy to create Linux builds on demand as well. :)   Install instructions Install  1. Unzip the file you have just downloaded (Arena-x86_64.zip) wherever you feel like. 2. This should create a folder (Arena-x86_64) that contains all the required files for the game. 3. Inside the folder you will find the binary (Game-x86_64.exe) to run the game. That should be it.  Please do not move the exe from its folder. It is required that the exe and dll files are in the same location.  If your antivirus tries to interfere for the greater good, you can run a scan on the files to make sure they are safe and then proceed.  Uninstall  To uninstall, just delete the folder and the game is gone forever. It does not modify or create any files outside of its own territory.",Action||Platformer||Shooter,2D||deathmatch||Pixel Art||Singleplayer,Arena,aronsoos.itch.io/arena

"Theme Interpretation  This year's GMTK Jam theme was  GENRE, but you can’t MECHANIC.  The interpretation we went for was three-fold: An action game where the player does not have a proper weapon, so our little bear knight only has a shield. A metroidvania-like game without power-ups, health drops, etc. All of the skills you need to finish the game at the start are available to you, and your health/shield regenerates over time. A non-violent platformer-like game, which is why in the game you can only stun enemies (and move past them) but when you re-enter the room they'll be back and ready to fight.  There are a couple different routes to the prize so please consider replaying it at least once more. There are 21 different rooms to explore.

"You're Becky. You started a new job. It's pretty simple. And totally NOT mundane. Created as part of Ludum Dare 38. Vote for us! Game Jam Stuff Short blurb about the jam. Feel free to skip. This is my second game jam, and second time doing LDJam. I'm quite pleased with how this entry turned out, so I hope everyone enjoys it. As per usual, I decided to be insane and learn an entire engine during the jam: it was my first time using GameMaker. Just to explain the take on the theme in case anyone misses it: Becky works so much that her entire world is her job. It's a very very small world. Only her, the coffee, a computer and some staplers. :( Outside of that, taking the theme literally, the original size of all the assets (and the game) is a tiny 189x125. I wanted to also try out using a different pixel style, palette, and using a palette restriction. Everything was created during the jam, except for the music/sounds, which was provided by others.

Created for the  2016 A Game By Its Cover  game jam and inspired by  this Famicase cover . And while the game jam has ended, this game is very much still in development! Look forward to updates in the coming weeks.   Controls:  Keyboard/mouse and standard XBOX gamepads are supported. Hold I / Back in-game to see all controls.     Features that could be cool to develop at some point:  More enemies and flowers, more diverse environments, friendly NPCs, better combat, story bits, boss battles, and of course SFX and music.   Changelog for v0.5 (21 August 2016):  Added skeleton run animation. Improved skeleton AI (now with pathfinding!) Added ""squirting cucumbers"". Hit them, and they go flying! Seeds hurt you  and  enemies. Now uses YoYo Compiler. It seems to work decently. General optimisation and minor text fixes. Hopefully it runs a bit better now. Still much to improve in terms of performance though!  Updates currently put on hold indefinitely, as I am busy with other things.

"About This Project  This is a personal fan game of mine that I had been working on for a working / interactive screen cosplay! I'm a huge fan of Undertale and this boss battle in particular, since it was such a departure from the rest of the game. So, obviously that meant that I had to remake it from scratch.   How To Play  Move:  Arrow Keys Action:  Z or Enter Fullscreen Toggle:  F4 Dodge as much as you can, call out for help, and fight to take down Flowey!   Visual Epilepsy Warning  Warning! This game contains flashing lights, static, and other such patterns, which could be potentially harmful to those who experience visual epilepsy! Play at your own risk, and take care!   Spoilers  This fan game has massive spoilers for the neutral ending of Undertale! So, if you haven't already, do yourself a favor and  go play Undertale!  It holds a very special place in my heart, and perhaps it will in yours, too.   Further Development Notice:  Sorry, but I don't have any plans to update this game any further, or make any ports of it to other platforms. My apologies to those who have been asking for that with no answers, but please don't wait with bated breath. Antivirus Flagging Notice: I'm pretty darn certain that this executable is virus/malware free, but some antiviruses may still flag it as a threat. This is not uncommon with executables compiled using GameMaker Studio. To combat this, I've included a downloadable ZIP file with an included readme file, which hopefully may help those who are getting their executables deleted/flagged. Additionally, if Chrome is denying you the ability to download either file, you can choose to allow the download via the menu button to the right of the download on the bottom of the Chrome window (if I remember correctly). However, please do report any high risk warnings if you come across any in the comments section below.",Action,Bullet Hell||Fangame||flowey||undertale,Your Best Nightmare,barkscript.itch.io/your-best-nightmare
"A new demo is available! Check it out here!   Baldi's Basics Plus enters early access this spring! Baldi's Basics - Full Game Early Demo  Ever since the  Baldi's Basics Kickstarter  was successfully funded, I've been working on a full version of the game. This demo offers a small slice of a couple of new features that will be in the full game,  random events and and special structures. This demo only includes one level, but in it you'll find some new structures, and you'll also get to experience the new random events that activate every few minutes! The full game will include the new features shown in this demo, as well as randomly generated levels, field trip mini-games, multiple levels of increasing difficulty, and more. Not to mention lots of new characters and items!  This game is still in development!  Remember, this demo is for a game that is still in development, which means that it will likely show the signs of something that is still a work-in-progress. Not all planned features are in the game yet, even some that were in the original game haven't been implemented yet, since I've been prioritizing other areas of development. So if you see something that seems unfinished, that's because it is! When the full game releases there will be much more polish than what you see now.  This game is still a horror game!  If you've never heard of Baldi's Basics before, it's important to know that this is not actual edutainment, but it is, in fact, a tongue-in-cheek horror game. It's family friendly, but still includes some things that could scare players. This demo  is  relatively light on horror-type content though, and the full game will have much more than what is seen here.  Controls  WASD - Move  Mouse - Turn  Shift - Run  Space - Look behind you  Tab - View map  Left click - Interact  Right click - Use items  Scroll wheel - Change items  Use the control mapper to change these controls to your liking!  Settings  Hold SHIFT when launching the game (Options on Mac) to access the settings. Here you can switch between full-screen and windowed, and select the resolution. Do not change the input settings however! Changing any inputs within the settings window may break the in-game controls.  In the game you can find more settings by clicking on the options option. Here you can change mouse sensitivity and volume, and re-map the controls to your liking.  Pre-order the full game through Backerkit   Visit the full game's Backerkit pre-order store!   Links  Website  Twitter  Kickstarter Updates  YouTube  Merch   Baldi's Basics merch!  FAQ  Why doesn't Gotta Sweep have a closet? Where's the You Can Think Pad? Why are all the faculty only rooms so empty?  If you have a question like this, the answer is simple: The game isn't finished yet! Like I said, there are still  lots  of things I haven't gotten around to adding yet. Right now I'm at the stage where I just program the game so that everything works, and I'll worry about adding the finer details closer to the end of the game's development.  Can I make mods of this demo?  I love seeing all the mods people make of the original game, but with this demo being for what will be a paid piece of software, I would prefer if any mods created for this were distributed without redistributing the game itself. What I mean is, any mods created for this should be shared by sharing the original files  you  created, with instructions that explain how users can install those files into their copy of the demo. This is something that will be absolutely necessary for mods of the full game when it releases.  Does this demo have a secret ending?  I'll save you all the trouble and confirm that this demo doesn't have a secret ending. The full game will have plenty of secrets though!  This isn't very scary. Is this still supposed to be a horror game?  This demo definitely doesn't have much focus on being creepy, mostly just on gameplay. In the full game, I plan on ensuring the game has more creepy elements to it, although I don't think it will ever be ""scary"". I'm going to go light on the jump scares (The Baldi jumpscare barely even counts as a jumpscare due to how predictable it is) and focus more and giving the game a creepy and unsettling atmosphere.  Will this demo be released for any mobile devices?  Nope, I have no plans to release this on mobile devices.  Have you pointed out that this demo is subject to change too many times?  Yes, but that's subject to change as well.  © 2019 Basically Games, LLC  Install instructions Download the desired .zip file for your platform.

CONTEXT  The year is 2221 and you are the lone technician aboard the Eye of Ra, an anti-asteroid space station orbiting Earth.  It has been two decades since the Apep event caused widespread disturbances throughout the Solar System. Ancient orbital paths and gravitational partnerships were forever altered, and our centuries-old knowledge of them was rendered unreliable. The calculated, near-zero risk of an asteroid impact on an inhabited world suddenly became unknown.  The Solar Union scrambled to recalculate the odds, to find lost objects before they could strike one of its five member worlds. Nuclear warheads were stockpiled and aimed at the skies of the Incorporated Planet of Mercury, the Republic of Mars, the Federation of Jupiter, and the Colonial Republic of Titan. Meanwhile, on Earth, they built something entirely new: the Ra laser. An orbital, Solar-powered cannon capable of reaching across the Solar System and removing kilometres-wide objects from existence.  The power within the Eye of Ra defends us all from the modern asteroid threat. The  Solar Union entrusts Earth with the protection of its member worlds, who in turn entrusts the Eye of Ra to one technician: you.

Imagine chess, but on a four-by-four grid, where pieces are swapped rather than moved, each piece has its own special ability and-- OK, not so much like chess.

Please get good at Feud so we can beat them.  Cross-platform!  Feud has full cross-platform play between PC, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android. This means you can play Feud at your boring job, then on the bus on the way home from your boring job, then on your computer at home while you recover from your boring job. Please note that we  do not recommend  playing Feud during your commute if you walk to work, especially if you live in a city with lots of open manhole covers which is pretty much what I imagine New York to be like.

"Did your ceiling always look like that?  Your vision peels at the edges, folding in. Everything is white, empty.  You spend a day seeing how many coins you can fit into the hollows above your collarbones.   You wonder how long it will take until there is nothing left of you to touch.     Overview  Made in 48 hours for the Global Game Jam 2018, Shrinking Pains is a short narrative experience that explores a semi-autobiographical struggle with anorexia through a mix of visual novel and interactive poetry.  Story  Play as a sufferer of anorexia as they navigate their life and relationships.   Characters  Choose your partner preference before you play.    Isabella is a gentle girl with a wicked sense of humour. She is a professional violinist with a great love of sitcoms.    Taylor is prickly young man with a warm heart. He works as a software engineer by day and sells his knitting on Etsy in his spare time.    Yuuto has been your best friend for years and put up with your emotional baggage as long as he's known you. He's reliable, dependable and can't text to save his life.    Vivienne's claw-like nails chime against her wineglass when she's talking. They leave long red marks against your skin as she pulls you to the door...   Hunter looks good smoking in his leather jacket. When he puts his hand on your neck you don't know if you feel excited or scared...   Content Warning  Shrinking Pains deals with potentially distressing themes of mental illness and destructive behaviour. Be warned that some of the content is fairly graphic and may be upsetting to some players.

"UPDATE:    We've released  a new game for iOS and Android.  Same bears, same farts but different challenges! Get it now FREE   here for Android  and here for   iOS version. The Bear's  Black Heart:  Race against hunger and increasing cold as you find food and interact with a host of characters.  Everybody you meet has unexpected replies to the choices you make and both their and your actions can be a little nutty sometimes! Can you reason with Eric the Actor? Can you seek directions from David Bowie's ghost?  Made in under two weeks for Wizard Jam 4, this game was a blast to make and maybe we'll revise it after some feedback.  Developed by  Abban Dunne   in Unity with art by  Bob  created in  Affinity Designer  .The music is by  Broke for Free .  We built this as part of  Wizard Jam 2016 . If you're interested in game development you can also check out the development log  here .  CHANGELOG  v1.1.0  Added status multipliers    fast & slow / noble & mingy / optimist & pessimist / satisfied & ravenous / fresh & stale / abundance & famine  - Will now add or remove in increments.   reversed  - Will only apply when the multiplier is an uneven number. So now it will toggle if you get it multiple times.   flatulence  - You fart more often when the status stacks up. (never thought I'd be typing that)    Tweaked heart and food from choices  Now the amount of food you get and heart you lose makes more sense when compared to the decisions. It will also list that you got them along with the status effect.  Show buttons for all choices  Now all the choices will be shown, but some of them will be inactive depending on how dark your heart is.  Fixed Spelling  I fixed some of the bad spelling mistakes and rewrote a little to make stuff line up with the decisions.  Food  Eating squirrels makes your heart a little blacker. More squirrels spawn.  Choice rooms  Added a max level counter to force a choice room if one hasn't appeared in a while.

"POST-RELEASE NOTICESA hotfix has been issued to solve a bug involving Teemo that would loop you through Teemo scenes over and over again or end the game prematurely! Please download the new version if you don't have the Teemo hotfix. Sorry!Additionally, a single-file patch that fixes an issue where saves mid dungeon cannot be loaded is available, simply replace the folder renpy/game.py with the patch file, included below. THE STORY At Summoner's Academy located in the city of Demacia, a cohort of students with one common interest create the high school's first League of Legends club. The game warps the players inside a virtual reality using a digital headset produced by Rito Games. All is well until an evil self-proclaimed genius hacker thwarts the corporation's success by infiltrating a highly encrypted glitch into the system! With a countdown of 7 days set by the perpetrator, the distressed CEO puts up a reward of 1 million Rito Points (a currency within the game) to unearth the miscreant in conjunction with sending out the company's own specialized hacker force. If the villain claims victory, League of Legends will be terminated forever. A MESSAGE FROM US Thank you to everyone who has stuck around through the whole 4 month journey. We started off as an ambitious volunteer group attempting the NaNoRenO game jam in March, but the project soon took off and got extended until June development. It was a rigorous ride, but we're finally pleased to announce that we've finished the game, albeit no QA testing.  There  will  be bugs, issues, and occasional crashes.  However, we're hoping you'll look past it and enjoy what we were able to put together! ( ´ ▽ ` )ﾉ Version 1.0 includes the entire dungeon, start to finish, with some dialogue. We also included some missing voice actor lines (although we weren't able to get all of them). No further content will be added to the game!  Although it was an... exhilarating experience, most everyone on the team has moved on to different obligations, though some developers are still available to make quality changes and bug fixes to come in a version 1.1! This was built by a community of fans of League of Legends, and hope that this will be a testament to how much we love LOL! For those who get confused during the game, we have a  list of bugs .

"Release Date (on Steam): 27th of April 2018 Apocryph on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/596240/  Apocryph is a FPS set in a brutal dark fantasy world. It takes it's roots in old-school fantasy shooters, so prepare for intense sword-and-sorcery FPS action amidst forgotten castles, evil shrines and decrepit dungeons! The world of Apocryph is a grim, violent place, harboring magic, dark rituals and dangers around every corner. Wherever you go you'll be facing unrelenting monsters, traps and locked passages, and can only depend on yourself and your equipment to survive the trials. - Static, carefully handcrafted levels and level-hubs, all packed with secrets, monsters and traps. - Your character can wield up to 9 different weapons with alternative fire modes, including melee armaments, spells, staffs and artifacts.  - Items can help you in tough situations, health potions will aid your health, mana vials can restore your mana, combat items can do some damage to an opponent.  - There are also more rare and powerful relics to be found, such as the dreaded Obliterator Mask, which encases you in a suit of nigh-impenetrable armor, allows you to bash enemies with your plain fists and send powerful shockwaves across the walls and floor, or the Essence of the Reaper, which turns you into an avatar of Death itself, boosting your speed, granting you wings to perform double jumps and a wicked scythe which cleaves and destroys any opponent. - Some weapons and items can be used to stun enemies, freeze them solid, deal area of effect damage or even provide defensive measures. - The game uses a sophisticated gore system. A powerful finishing blow can rip a part of the enemy right out of him, while critically over damaging an opponent literally blows them to pieces, with limbs flying across the room and sticking to the walls. You control the Arbiter, once a person of a high rank in Xilai religious hierarchy. The Xilai were known for many things, such as their artistry, magical arts and unity. But all the worlds feared them for a different reason - the Xilai worshiped Death itself. For centuries they raided countless worlds, reaping souls in the name of their dreaded Mistress.  Events preceding the game have led to your exile, and now, after many years you return back, only to find fortresses and lands overrun with demonic spawns and vile beasts. Why were you exiled? What could cause this desolation? It's time to find some answers... and reap some demon spawn in the name of Pale Mistress. Apocryph is currently in early development. There's still a lot of items, biomes and rooms to add to the game, as well as game modes, plot advances and perks.

Please check it out, even if you played the old demo already! You can download it from this very itch.io page. Give us a rating too once you're done! - FOR THE LATEST NEWS,  CHECK OUT THE LOVESICK DARLINGS KICKSTARTER UPDATES PAGE! EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO IT! https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lovesickdarlings/lovesick-darlings-a-visual-novel-with-consequences/posts - WE HAVE A STEAM PAGE! HECK YEAH!  Wishlist LoveSick Darlings now! (this really helps!): https://store.steampowered.com/app/1151410/LoveSick_Darlings/  Hello! Welcome to the official page for  LoveSick Darlings ! For other less-pressing news and updates regarding this game, scroll to the bottom of this page and check out the developer logs and blog posts I do every fortnight. If you're checking out the game for the first time though, read on! What is LoveSick Darlings?  LoveSick Darlings  is a visual novel focused on creating and testing the limits of teenage relationships. It explores friendship, high school life, love, and everything in between. The game plays with tropes and expectations found in romance visual novels and dating sims by undercutting this often-romanticized period of everyone's lives with a realistic edge.  Syd , our protagonist, moved into town at the start of this year. He’s become best friends with a girl called  Maisy  who lives on the same street with him – and by extension, her friends too. Over time he has become a natural part of this diverse group of friends. The school year is growing closer to its end, and Syd’s friends are pressuring him into asking his crush out to the formal at the end of the year. Will he be able to do it? How will his friendships hold up around him as he makes these big decisions towards the end of this high school year? And what if someone in his own group of friends sees him as more than...  "" just a friend"" ? It's up to  you  to make these hard decisions and deal with these situations as Syd to decide the fate of him and all of his friends.  And that is where our story begins.   What do you do in the game?  Get immersed in the setting of Foster Hills High as you spend Syd's days hanging out with his friends at school and choose who you spend time with after school. Watch as everyone's daily lives and struggles play out and decide how Syd and his friends react to what is going around him. Gameplay features include free time events (inspired by the  Persona  and  Danganronpa  franchises), and a branching story with dozens of paths and outcomes that flow seamlessly between each other. Every choice you make and everything you say as Syd matters. Explore the bonds Syd has with the many ""group conversations"" he and his friends engage with, then put your social skills and decision making to the test in in-game events known as ""Social Events"" where you spend time with the cast as a group and get to know them better. Build relationships with the main three girls by spending ""free time"" with who you like best! But watch out, as how and who you spend your time with can have all kinds of consequences... But most of all, have fun and enjoy building bonds with the characters in a natural and free way.   How do I play?  After a lot of hard work by myself and several others I hired, I have readied a ""demo"" or ""preview"" version of the game for the public to enjoy! One run is about 6 hours long depending on reading speed. To see all the possibilities and explore every choice is at least an extra three hours. So, there's a lot of content to start with!  I would say more about the content of the game, but I feel like the less you know, the better your experience will be. I recommend just diving in and playing it now! The rest of this page is mostly just supplementary information for those interested in the background of this project.  Click the download button above or at the bottom of the page to play now!  DISCLAIMERS: - Not all art assets have been finalized. There are occasionally place-holder images and sprites found in the game.  This can occasionally mean blank backgrounds and silhouettes for sprites of side characters. I apologize for this and hope you enjoy the game despite this.  - The game intended for mature audiences. There are  no  ""adult"" (18+) scenes in the game, but the game does feature: sexual references, adult themes, and coarse language. All things which you'd typically find in any High School friend-group.  - Supported systems: Windows, Mac, Linux.  - If you encounter any bugs or issues at all, let me know ASAP. Contact me over Twitter (@LoveSickDarling) or via itch.io so I can fix them quickly :)  Trigger warnings (light spoilers for the in-game story): - A main character is shown to be in an emotionally manipulative/abusive relationship with someone else. There is no physical violence whatsoever. Just emotional manipulation and damage.  - A different main character is shown to have an abusive parent with hoarding tendencies. There is no physical violence.  - Light mentions and themes of self-worth and mental health. There is no violence.   How much does this cost?  This demo is  absolutely 100% free. No cost or payment needed . Play it. Give it a whirl, have fun, and give me feedback if you'd like!  If you are so generous as to support this game and its future, donations are welcome. But there is no obligation.  100% of all funds I receive  will go to funding this project's future. I cannot thank you enough if you do decide to financially support this project in any way.   Why is this just a ""demo/preview version""?  LoveSick Darlings  is the first game I have ever made. It's been a huge learning process, and frankly, I just want to get what I have so far of the game out there. I'm a creative at heart and just want people to enjoy my content. Let me know what you think of the game, I'd love to hear feedback! (Message me on here, or @LoveSickDarling on Twitter.)  This demo represents about one quarter of the content in one complete ""run"" of the game. However, once multiple endings and paths are factored in - this demo is more like an eighth of the planned total content that will be found in the full game across multiple play-throughs.   Character Profiles      What makes  LoveSick Darlings  different?  This game is based off the single premise of my frustrations with how romance is often handled in dating sims, RPGs, and games as a whole.  The question I’ve always had in dating sims and games with “romance” options and similar character-based interactive experiences is why none of the other potential romance partners  or wider cast  ever  acknowledge  or comment  on the player’s relationships  at all (looking at you  Persona ). I may just be playing the wrong games, but the only two games to meaningfully have another character reference my character’s romantic partner were  The Witcher 3   and  Dragon Age Origins .  Neither of which are dating sims or even visual novels for that matter.  Which is why I thought  ""what if a visual novel did acknowledge those kinds of things?""  Like, maybe if you start being too nice to one girl - the other gets jealous. Or one gets more and more desperate for your attention if you spend too much time with other girls/characters. And thus,  LoveSick Darlings  was born.  The biggest interactive element in  LoveSick Darlings  is what each of the girls think of your relationships with the other girls.  This is also what I am most proud of in the game, and I hope you feel like your experience was tailored to the choices and decisions you made in-game.  This might sound like wish fulfillment , but I am trying to emulate high school as best as one can. The forming  of romantic relationships  within these friend groups  around the age of 16  and the ensuing gossip or meddling  is a  common high school experience - this ""group dynamic"" is what I'm trying my best to realistically recreate in game format.  This game has a very targeted focus on realistic character relationships and growth in a way that not many visual novels I've encountered have tried. To have your relationship and reputation status with each character be recognized by all of the cast - and to which they react accordingly - is the defining principle that sets  LoveSick Darlings  apart from other romance visual novels set in high schools. These games hardly ever recognize how powerful a ""group dynamic"" can be in swaying and defining relationships.   Who made this?  I, Dimitri Adoniou, may be the writer and project lead but this game was made possible with the art and music work I commissioned from distinguished artists like Ippers and PhiPhi  - and original music from Tim Reichert. The list of people who contributed goes on, too. Check them out below. But about me? I am a graduate from the University of Canberra who studied writing with a focus on screenwriting and film in a far-off magical made-up land called Australia. I usually do work in writing articles, film scripts, and trying to get my TV pilots off the ground.  LoveSick Darling s is my major creative project at the moment, and has my full attention dedicated towards it. It is also my first game project or visual novel I have ever published.   What is the future of  LoveSick Darlings ?  So, now that you've seen all this about the game, you might be wondering: ""If this is a demo, where is the full game?""  On January 3rd, LoveSick Darlings concluded it's Kickstarter campaigned and raised $8300 AUD! Wow! Check out the Kickstarter page here: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lovesickdarlings/lovesick-darlings-a-visual-novel-with-consequences/posts/2726215 The game is looking at a Q3 2020 release date! I hope you look forward to it!   Conclusion  This is probably a page with too much detail at this stage, but I felt like I owed it to everyone who gave their time to play and give my game a go to explain as much as I could about the project's past, present, and future. I hope you all stay for the ride and see where this project takes us.

"Rail Route is a train dispatcher simulator. You negotiate contracts, build railroads, set up routes for trains and control the traffic. Unlock features to your dispatcher interface, upgrade railway network elements and research new technologies that allow you to automate the operations!  You can download and play the game in the alpha version for free (developer preview) before we release the full game.  Join our discord:  https://discord.gg/avBjPqT Follow us on twitter:  https://twitter.com/RailRouteGame Homepage:  https://railroute.bitrich.info    Game Features  Manual Routing   Manual Routing  is basic mode to control the railroad from the beginning of the game. You set up switches and signals one by one. Nothing but your skill and focus prevent collisions.  Automated Routing   Automated Routing  helps when traffic becomes busy on a complex yard. You need a few clicks to set up all switches and signals en route. Collision avoidance included. Available later in the game when you research it and upgrade your signals.  Contracts   Contracts  build your traffic. Except a few in beginning, you choose the most profitable contract that fills a gap in your schedule by own. But there is a trial first! It adjusts the payments (according to your rail network performance) and creates the timetable for all future trains.  Building   Build your own rail network to optimize the traffic. Be creative and fill every possible space you have.  Automation   Automation  allows you to operate your railway network without your hands on. Your growing traffic does not lock you in operations, freeing your hands for further expansion. It works in a record-and-replay manner: you just do what you want to be repeated for each subsequent train of the same contract. When certain event happens, rules you create are executed – automation can create routes from the automated signals.  Level Editor   With the level editor we allow you to create fully custom board with everything that comes with it. Create a schematic of your hometown railroads, your imaginary railroad network or even create a London tube map using it! The rectangles you see moving can be modern or historic trains, the underground trains, trams, monorails, just whatever you imagine.  Include a custom timetable to create various puzzle levels or just a real world scenario.  Scored Levels  Reach the highest score with the custom made scenarios (a few levels already included in the game). Solve the  dispatching problems as precisely as possible and be rewarded by the good work done. Share your score with us!  Find more levels at our  community discord .  Future roadmap  The game is an active development. These are the features we are currently working on:  Advanced s cheduling  - adjust your timetable for even more control More  game mechanics  - more features to unlock through research, goals and technologies to be used in free game mode Graphics overhaul  - the game will be more visually attractive and much more!  Stay tuned for the future updates!  Disclaimer:  Any purchase of this title in this alpha phase is solely the support of the game development.

"“TAPE” is a psychological horror game for PS4 and PC with time puzzle mechanics and deep narrative, in which you’ll have to help Iria discover the location of her father who disappeared years ago.  Using an old Super8 camera, Iria will be able to affect the time of the objects around her, exploring her deepest memories while resolving puzzles and escaping from the nightmares that dwell in her past.  About the game  Born as our Master's Degree Project, TAPE it's a demo version presented as contestant for the PlayStation Talents 2017 and  winner of the Most Innovative Game at the PlayStation Awards Spain 2017 .     Inspired by games as SOMA or Silent Hill, TAPE wants to make you think, to be suspicious of everything and above all, tell you a story.     We hope you enjoy it!  The folks from  @BlackChiliGoat .   This demo was made by the following individuals:  Cast  María Chaves as Iria Salvador Miralles as Anxo  Writing  José Massa  ( @JsphMassa )  Programming  Carlos Orueta Moreno Álvaro Espinosa Marlasca Miguel Ángel Alfaro  ( @alfarom_dev )  Design  José Massa ( @JsphMassa ) Toni Alarcón Mesquida ( @tonimi91 ) Pablo Rodríguez-Tembleco Guilabert ( @PauThePlayer ) Miguel Ángel Alfaro ( @alfarom_dev )   Art  Laura Torres de Lucas ( @Duilu_Lau ) Daniel Rodrigo Solanas Sara Martín Polo Jesús Vetia Sergio Moreno Carlos Montero Cabello  Technical Art   Toni Alarcón Mesquida ( @tonimi91 )   Music  Pablo Rodríguez-Tembleco Guilabert ( @PauThePlayer )   This game is an alpha version of the game and does not represent the final quality of the game. Install instructions Thanks for browsing our game!  About Controls   Since this project was designed for PlayStation 4, we recommend to play it with a PS Controller or similar.   If you're playing with Keyboard and Mouse, the controls are as follows:  WASD - Movement Left Control - Crouch Left Shift - Run (You'll make noise!) E - Interact Q - Equip/Unequip Camera (Once you obtain it) With the Camera Equipped Left Click - Rewind Story Items Right Click - Forward Story Items Left Click + Right Click - Pause Story Items Esc - Menu  Tips  Iria's camera can start affecting objects if they're inside the Focus (the white circle in the middle). To keep affecting them you'll need to keep them inside the screen.    An object affected by the camera can't pass through other objects or Iria herself.    Some objects will try to go back to their initial condition, unless you Rewind or Forward them completely. Also, you can Pause them.    Iria's camera can be used to defend yourself.  This project it's still on an Alpha stage and, since we are working on it, we'll love to see your gameplays and read your feedback. Also, the story it's presented in a vague way, and we'll develop it further in the future, but we'll love to hear your opinion about it.  Sorry for the bugs and thanks for your time!

"Background:  Lenora Calamint lives with her mother in a small village called Pokeweed Hollow on the outskirts of a forest. She often delivers food to her stubborn grandmother, who prefers to live alone in the woods. While the forest is a dangerous place full of wolves, the village and her grandmother's house were peaceful.   However, once a travelling, charismatic hunter decided to settle near the village and offered to protect it, the local wolves became mysteriously violent and began to attack the village in erratic bursts of activity. Due to these events, some villagers praise the hunter for his help in keeping the wolves out of their homes. The others can't help but think there's something suspicious about the matter. Despite it all, Lenora still has a grandmother to take care of, and so she wakes up to begin her routine of visiting her grandmother anew.

"Breaking news! A new teleprompter simulation game has been officially submitted for the #resistjam event.

"An experimental puzzle platformer game where structures are only solid when illuminated. I hope you find the puzzles innovative, challenging, and entertaining. UPDATE.   I went in and fixed up the controls, switching the jump button to space and using up (or down, or ctrl) for interacting with items. Now it's difficult for me, since I'm used to jumping with up, but more sensible for ... everyone else, it makes wall-jumping much easier. I haven't yet fixed how input handling is wonky and occasionally misses a press, sorry about that! I hope it doesn't mess anyone up in too frustrating a situation. I'm working on it. :)  Even more important is  there is music now ! ( It might take a minute to load while you start playing)  The amazing  Zach Heyde  took it upon himself to compose original background music!  You can mute it with m ,  but why would you? It's really phenomenal. If you need music for your projects, you should check Zach out. Commission him for everything! You can find the OST here:  https://zachheyde.bandcamp.com/track/shadowbright-ost  ---  Use the LEFT/RIGHT or A/D to move, SPACE to jump, and UP, DOWN, W, or S to pick up/drop items and switch switches. You can also use a gamepad. Your objective is to get the character to the dotted rectangular goal for each level. The music can be muted with M.  Enjoy!  I'm proud of this little game and I want to show it off, and get feedback. Is it done? Nope. There's so much I want to improve! But it never will be 'done'. I've moved on to other things, and I am happy with what's here. I believe the core ideas are interesting and inspiring, and the execution at is least competent. This little game was fun to make and I hope you enjoy it.",Platformer||Puzzle,2D||Unity,Shadowbright,blooper.itch.io/shadowbright

"Squirrely Roo Rabbit  is an in-development puzzle-platformer game relying on color theory to solve environmental challenges. It features a visual style reminiscent of hand-drawn and -watercolored pop-up storybooks. The game’s story begins with a gang of chameleons on a coloring spree swap changing the colors of all the animals in their wake, causing confusion and upset. Squirrely Roo Rabbit, who is unaffected due to her being a non-traditional animal, teams up with an outcast chameleon, Cammy, to track down Leon, the Chameleon king, and return the forest to normal. With the help of other animals they meet along the way and their local fruits, Squirrely Roo and Cammie solve environmental puzzles using color as they explore new lands.  Squirrely Roo Rabbit  began in Fall 2016 as a senior thesis project by Boba Studios at the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA).

"A grand strategy game, in which you take the role of an ancient evil, come to destroy the empires of humankind. Initially weak, you work by sowing dissent in a complex political environment, taking over a low-ranking noble and working your way up. Play factions against each other, and support dissidents to provoke civil wars, all the while building up your forces.  An Open-Source sequel to a previous game, with a new focus on playability and coherent, polished gameplay. Repository available at:   https://github.com/AlexanderWild/ShadowsBehindTheThrone  Note:  This game is under development, and this current build is the very first, still lacking a variety of features before it can be considered ""feature complete"". Early release in order to get feedback, should anyone have any.  Gameplay Overview  The world simulates a set of nobles, all with their own aims and interests. They existing in societies, and vote to achieve their ends. By proposing votes, and voting strategically, you can manipulate them into failing to respond to the true threat, your slowly-developing hidden forces.  Set silversmiths against wine-makers, while subverting coastal villages to build an army of Deep One fish-people, waiting to storm the surface. Rally your kingdom against another, while supporting dissident nobles in the other in order to provoke civil war, weakening them such that they make easy prey. Grow horrific fields of fleshy limbs and gnashing teeth to terrify the nobles into failing to realise that your enthralled noble is slowly converting them from within into dark cultists.  A Let's Play!  We've recorded a video showing an overview of the game. It's intended to give a rough beginner's guide to the game (at least the version 1 of the game). It's a bit long, but hopefully it could help beginner players to get their bearings, and to show the community how we regard the ""classic"" gameplay (of course any strategy that works is a valid strategy).  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tLD1XV9LeU   Credits  Development by  Alexander Wild, Wyatt Lindquist, Tasneem Solie  Main screen art by Derek Restivo   Controls   Mouse + Keyboard.  Mouse handles camera panning, selecting (left to move/inspect, right to select), menu button clicking.  Keyboard camera panning through WASD or arrow keys, map-view lenses bound to number keys  Mouse wheel or z/x keys for map zoom  Minimum specs   Minor.   2D graphics and turn based nature require little in the way of CPU or GPU power. Prefer screen resolutions of 1366x768 or above, but tested and functional on lower. Memory footprint around 200meg.   Development  Hopefully development will continue as the other project did, although at a slower rate. New versions will come out, and community feedback (should you wish to provide any) listened to and accommodated if possible.  You are welcome to view the source code for your own purposes.

"A sequel is now out! A newer, more open-source (licensing to be decided) version, aimed at streamlining the gameplay is now out: https://bobbytwohands.itch.io/shadows-behind-the-throne-2  Shadows Behind the Throne is a strategy game inspired by Crusader Kings, Pandemic and That Which Sleeps. You play as the omnipresent yet weak force of darkness, seeking to bring an end to the current age of light. Your tools are political intrigue and large-scale yet imprecise world-manipulation.  Take low-ranking barons under your control, and through political negotiations make them great emperors, secretly spreading your shadow across their entire kingdoms. Take a small county and, though natural rituals, bring a global ice age except for your own small patch of land, and bring the people of the world to you as desperate refugees seeking the last warmth. Or simply take a baron, start a plague, a couple of civil wars and take the world by force as your enemies are divided.  State of the game:  As it stands, the game is intended to be a framework for more features and further development.  That said, it is entirely playable, from beginning to end, features a range of playstyles and strategies.  It's unbalanced and chaotic, but possibly in a good and fun way.  Two versions are available, the older V13, which is hex-based, and has a wide range of different types of dark magic and powers, but has rather unfinished UI work, and the newer versions, starting at V20. These are location-and-link based, and are more polished, but lack some of the variety of the earlier versions (for now).

"Come out in college! Meet people, make friends, and maybe find a boyfriend?  Yearning: A Gay Story  (YAGS for short) is a coming-out-focused character-driven slice-of-life visual novel with dating sim elements (phew) where you play as a gay man starting his freshman year of college at a generic university somewhere in the midwestern United States.  You will interact with a cast of characters, each with their own personality and stories, as you navigate college life, develop friendships, play board games, and come out. With luck, you might even find a boyfriend.   A world where you can befriend people and see events from different perspectives, depending on your decisions 4 dateable guys* with their own distinct stories, with good and bad endings for each guy (9 endings in all*) 230,000+ words and meaningful choices Collectibles system to track and reward your decisions Achievements, for completionists Unlockable in-game character profiles  * Or are there?    This is not an explicit game. All nudity is censored, and sex is neither shown nor explicitly described. However, the game does feature strong language, adult situations, implied nudity, and implied (gay) sex. Parental discretion is advised. If you are of legal age and can legally view adult materials in your area, you can download a free patch  here  that will enable uncensoring of nudity, as well as more explicit text, within the game.   YAGS is a personal project by Bob Conway. A development log for the game and extended credits can be found at  http://yags.bobcgames.com  The primary goal of the game was to focus on and portray a more realistic coming-out experience, complete with the fear, uncertainty, and reluctance involved in the process. It also aims to follow your relationship with someone ( if  that happens), in the larger context of their existing friendships.  YAGS is not meant to be a short game, but I hope that its length is justified in the end. Please allot several hours for each playthrough, and make liberal use of the save functionality.

"Full Version on Steam!  	 Gone with the Demon  is a first-person modern dungeon brawler game in which the player explores a creepy labyrinthine environment, battling vicious demons and possessed enemies who grow stronger every time the player dies in a directional, fluid, solid combat system.  FEATURES 	 Bidirectional combat system that suits the first-person perspective  	Basically, all the attacks in the game come from the left or right side, so the direction of the attack must be determined before dealing with it. Unlike the third-person view, in the first-person view it is easier to know which direction the enemy is attacking from without indicators by seeing the enemy's movements, making combat more immersive. 	 Terrifying enemies encouraged by the player's death  	The labyrinthine corridors and rooms are filled with mysterious demons and possessed enemies. Of course, there are gargantuan demon bosses. When you are killed by enemies, they grow stronger. You have to make an offering to a Totem to turn the enemies back to normal or fight against enemies that constantly test you. 	 A variety of movements with fluid controls that are easy to grasp  	The game provides players with a variety of movements like block, dodge, counterattack, guard break, backstabbing, and weapon-specific combos. You will need to make use of all your movements and fight strategically. It's important to work on seeing the enemy's movement and knowing when to attack or block. 	 Diverse melee weapons and projectiles  	Pipe wrenches, knives, baseball bats, sledgehammers and a lot more tools. 	Each weapon has unique stats and a unique move set. Figure out which weapon is more effective to which enemy. Also, you may throw stones and bricks to attract enemies or Molotov cocktails to 	 BURN THEM ALL . 	 Dangerous or helpful secrets  	Look around, find notes and break crates to reveal hidden paths and items. Watch your step to avoid traps. If you discover the traps in advance, you can lead enemies into the traps. 	 Level-up  	Collect Demon Essence and spend it to enhance character abilities and buy items. 	Character abilities will determine character personalities and game playstyles. 	 Supports game controllers with rumble.

"Welcome, traveler!  Wrestle honey badgers! Start forest fires! Ride grizzly bears as a beekeeper! FARA is a text-based roguelike that runs in your browser and has over 60 classes, a never-ending supply of dungeons, and countless secrets. The goal of the game is to collect enough Key Fragments to complete the Astral Key. Fragments can be found in many places - the depths of dangerous dungeons, the bottoms of lakes, or even in the pockets of unwitting strangers.  Most notable actions in the game add to a score, and when you die, your score is added to a persistent total that unlocks new options the next time you play. FARA is in the alpha stage, and is buggy as hell. Feedback and  bug reports  are desired and encouraged!  Discord ( https://discord.gg/FEp52yj )  Reddit  ( https://www.reddit.com/r/fara/ )  Twitter  ( https://twitter.com/PlayFARA )  Patreon  ( https://www.patreon.com/playfara )  Email  (support@playfara.com)  Bug reports are particularly helpful at this stage since they have the nasty tendency  to stop the game dead in its tracks.  The web and desktop versions of FARA are updated a few times a week.   HOW TO PLAY  Use the  [ Arrow Keys ]  to move, press   [ Tab ]   to cycle through targets,  [ e ]   to interact,  [ a ]  to attack, and  [ t ]  to take things. If command lines and shortcuts aren't really your thing,  you can also click/tap around the interface to perform most actions . There's way more to FARA, but that should be enough to get you  killed  started.   Latest Patch - 2019.05.21   The first public alpha for FARA was released one year ago today! I can't put into words how grateful I am to everyone who's taken the time to try FARA out and provide feedback. This game wouldn't be even half of what it is today were it not for the enthusiastic, welcoming, and dedicated community which has built up over the last year. I've wanted to be a game dev since I was a kid, and the FARA community has made that dream more fulfilling than I ever thought possible. You all have been incredible, and I look forward to the continued discourse that has shaped the game into something so many people find enjoyable. Now, let's celebrate the occasion by making the game way harder:  - Key Fragments no longer resurrect the player when killed. - Added a new innate spell to the player character - Astral Blessing. This ability expends ALL collected Key Fragments to completely restore health, stamina, and mood. Astral Blessing also bestows several positive effects for a moderate duration, removes all hunger and thirst, and damages nearby enemies. - Started working on some public leaderboard stuff. When a character of notable achievement dies, retires, slays a dungeon boss, or completes the Astral Key, an announcement will be made in the FARA Discord (https://discordapp.com/invite/TxECEtn). You can set a username ingame with /setusername yourname. You can opt out of this feature with /eventsharing. - Increased the importance of dexterity for reliably hitting targets with ranged weapons - Removed the strength bonus from ranged weapon damage - Made some changes to the start of the game - Removed wooden planks from the game and adjusted crafting recipes for objects which used them - Individual keybindings can now be reset with '/setkey keytochange default' - Made an adjustment which should make it a little easier to build shelters when you have allies following you - Typing /define without specifying any text wil now show all glossary entries. - Non-sentient entities can no longer be knocked prone. - Fixed several broken commands issued via mouse menu - Fixed an issue which prevented the [ z ] key from being re-bound - Fixed an issue which allowed certain monster abilities to work on slain entities - Fixed a bug that allowed traps be salvaged with /salvageall. - Fixed (more) issues with the Pounce ability - Fixed an edge case with Elder riddles which allowed duplicates of certain answers - Fixed a crash caused by entering castles  A fresh game is required in order to continue regular play.",Role Playing||Adventure,Endless||Fantasy||Perma Death||Procedural Generation||Retro||Roguelike||Sandbox||Singleplayer||Text based,FARA,brianiscreative.itch.io/fara

"“Forest's Secret” is a cozy, nonviolent adventure game.  You play as a traveler who has just arrived at a quiet forest settlement called Wabika, and must explore its mysterious paths, discover its ancient history, and make friends with its quirky inhabitants in order to find what it is you're searching for. There’s lots of neat little stuff to discover!  This game is playable on Windows, Mac, and Linux. Please check the Download & Install instructions for more information.  Before downloading, please note that the game is free and the donation is optional  - only pay if you wish to! I'm just happy that you're playing the game at all.    What is ""Mystery of the Frost""?  ""Mystery of the Frost"" is additional content on top of Forest's Secret. It adds new story, new areas, and more!  It also has gameplay elements that the original didn't, so I think it should be an interesting experience.  How do I play it?  The game file now includes both the original and new story. To start the ""Mystery of the Frost"" chapter of Forest's Secret, you must complete all 6 main quests, then leave Wabika and activate the credits. When you return to the main menu, the new chapter will begin. If you don't know which quests you haven't completed, you can talk to the statue in the back of the shrine for some hints. If you've already completed Forest's Secret's main story and all 6 quests prior to this patch, your save file will still work - you can activate the new content by leaving Wabika.  If you don't have access to your old save file, but don't want to replay the base game's story again, you can type FROST in the main menu to begin from the new part of the story. Warning: This will overwrite old save data, so only do it if you're sure!",Adventure,2D||Cozy||Non violent||Top-Down,Forest's Secret,bynine.itch.io/forestssecret

"The storm appeared suddenly, tossing Robin's ship against sharp cliffs. Shipwrecked and lucky to be alive, he finds himself on the beach of a mysterious island inhabited by strange friends...and enemies. Now, to find a way home, he must explore, make allies and master the mysteries of his new surroundings. Mysterious Island offers a unique mix of adventure, role-playing and real-time strategy, with control of up to 5 characters. Danger lurks around every corner, as well as adventure. Are you ready to discover if the last of the dragons really lives somewhere in the islands?  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Shortened game's description.  Our friends' yacht crashed by the coast of The Mysterious Island. Fortunately, everyone survives reaching dry land. The first task for the player is to find the rest of his friends. At the shore we can find wrack of ship. It is sensible to check all chests washed ashore by the storm to find some food and tools which are necessary in the next part of the game.  We can find that The Island is inhabited, but part of residents is not friendly to visitors, so the player has to search for weapon for self-defense. During our adventures at The Mysterious Island we are accompanied by the ghost of the Island. To contact with the ghost we use totems, so he can give us some wise advice what to do or where to go.  First part of the game is dominated by crabs, bloodthirsty plants and crocodiles. Player should be aware of these dangerous plants because it can lure beneath the ground and can attack rapidly. Also crocodiles may be dangerous, especially when there are many of them.  Find your friends and talk to them. They will surly share with you with their observations, you will know how they feel, if they need some food or sleep.   Distribute tools and weapon among your friends – they can act on their own if they have all important stuff (especially in camping mode).  After finding your friends you have to start settlement. The best place for a camp is a land where soil is suitable for cultivation with lots of trees and bushes. Camp will allow you to supply reserves of food all important items, it will also allow you to rest before inland journeys.   When you have settled a camp your friends can organize other works (if they have all necessary objects), and if needed they can feed or defend on their own. On the trips deep into the land you can take as many friends as you want – the rest will stay at the camp working and resting.  You will find out soon, that there is a local village nearby. Natives are open and friendly to visitors. If you talk to their chief – Shaman you can get some valuable information about the island, creatures and different threats. Inhabitants can show you some places where you can find materials for building a raft. Player can trade with them as well.  This is a good moment to start raft's construction. For building you need some wood and a hatchet. Player can hand this job over to his friends. They will do this job as long as they have enough materials for building.  After gathering enough wooden logs you need ropes. The easiest way to find it is to look around a Stone Labyrinth and Ancient City. But be careful – there live a lot of dangerous creatures. Also you can buy rope from natives in exchange of fruits. If you want to decide for this exchange it is reasonable to have well developed plantation, because you have to take care of your own team as well.  Next step is to find a compass. You can get some information from   Shaman about the wrack of ship at the coast. Player should be aware of see monster – it can be rally dangerous. Only if your team is well prepared can you set out on a journey for compass.  Your raft is almost ready, but the last thing you need is to find some canvas for sail. Once again it is good to ask Shaman for some wise advice. He reveals you a secret that in the other part of the island lives The Last Dragon and only in its cave you can find some strong canvas. The Dragon is a great glutton so it would be a good idea to take a present for it – a cake baked by inhabitants in exchange of some shells. If you already have a cake for The Dragon you can set out. During a trip it turns out that you have to fix a bridge you came across. You need a few logs and a hammer.  This mission appears to be more difficult. The player has to get through the mountains overcoming ranging monkeys. It can be necessary to send one of your friends back to the camp for some food and arrows. When our hero finds The Last Dragon it is very pleased with the cake and you can easily take some canvas from its cave.  In the return journey through the mountains a strange thing happens – one of your friends disappears. After getting back to the village Shaman tells you that it can be caused by a Witch.   The Castle of Witch is protected by magic charm and mission won't be easy. Fortunately Shaman promises to help you and to break the spell guarding the entrance to the castle.To do this he needs a magic amulet- The Great Pearl. It is guarded by The Minotaur, which lives in a cave at the end of The Stone Labyrinth.  Before setting out on a journey for amulet you have to take a rest and gather some food. Walking through The Ancient City player has to get to The Stone Labyrinth and, at the end, to the cave of Minotaur. The ghost of the Island helps you to find the right way. With a bit of luck you can defeat Minotaur and get the Amulet. In this cave player can also find a lot of materials, which can be useful after getting back to the camp. After getting back the pearl the  Shaman breaks the spell guarding the castle. Player can exchange founded materials for some better weapon (preferably the magic lucks?) Now we can set out for meeting with our destiny….(Witch)  Defeating the witch results in liberality of our friends. We finish the raft and end the game.  In the final version of the game on alternative way of finishing the game is also possible. The villagers will have another raft exchangeable for coins gathered after killing monsters.  The game has no specified time limits, however as the time passes   The Evil Witch gains strength and so the monsters inhabiting the island become more deadly.  The Lands  The coast . There we begin our adventure gather teammates and basic tools. It is also to start building a raft here.  Local village.  There we can learn about the island. The villagers can sell us supplies and tools. The Shaman can give you a few valuable advices, he can help you when the witch kidnaps a member of your team as well.  Shallow waters-  The sea monster. The sea monster sits on a chest containing the compass – a tool indispensable for sailing the sea. Without it the team will not be able to find their way home.  Ruins of the  Ancient City . Quite a dangerous place. The only way to the labyrinth leads through the city. Around it there are herbs necessary to make a cure for bites. Also, here yup can find edible plants with seeds that can be pleased elsewhere on the island. There is a place where a bridge on the road is broken. To get through the team must chop down a dead tree growing near path to make a new bridge over canyon.  The Stone Labyrinth.  It is the only way to Minotaur cave. The Minotaur is a guardian of the magic amulet which must be returned to the Shaman. There we can also find herbs, tools and weapons (it is good to look for some ropes necessary for the raft). As of the enemies, we will encounter mainly gelatins and some stone warriors (warning: some gelatins may be poisonous, and the stone warriors can't be entirely defeated. After getting hit they crumble into a heap of rocks only to reassemble again, after some time ready for battle.)  The Cave.  There we meet The Minotaur, who guards The Amulet. Deep inside there are some materials. If we have a pickaxe, we can mine some coal, iron ore and gold. Out of them our companion, the robot can make the missing tools. The minerals are also interesting for the locals, and can be exchanged for other goods.  The Wasteland . It is on the way of The Last Dragon and The evil Witch. It is very dangerous here. Before we enter into the wasteland our team members must be well trained in fight and properly equipped in weapons. The wasteland also has a broken bridge which the team has to fix in order to proceed with the ghost. A hammer and some wooden logs will come in handy. Here we will also find some useful herbs. Most of the enemies will be lizards and skeletons.  The Mountains.  It is the road to the Last Dragon's Cave. The temperature here is very low so, it's easy to catch a cold, which must be cured with herbs and rest. Fortunately some of them grow here. The main opponents will be witch-pressed monkeys.  Last Dragon's Lair.  The dragon is a loner unused to company so he talks to strangers unwillingly. He is a glutton through, so if we offer him some sweets he will let us pick a gift from among the objects gathered inside his lair. We can also find strong canvas in there – it is the best material for raft's sail. The Dragon will offer you help in building raft and will be pleased entering your team.  The Castle of The Evil Witch.  This is the place you have to come to free your friends. It turns out that a magic book took hold of The Evil Witch causing changes in her behavior. If you break the magic connection between The Witch and The book, curse of The book disappears and The Evil Witch will wake up. She won't be so dangerous from now. You will know what had happened and you can free your friends,  Directing characters  You can easily use a mouse to control. Pointing out an object causes the action of the character – it talks, picks out an object, fights or does some other activities. Acting depends on the object we choose.Commands to other members of the team we give in a dialog form. To direct the team you have to pass other members appropriate objects and switch to camping mode. That's enough for members to act – they know what they need. In the team mode characters act, fight and rest depending on the chief behavior. Through the dialog you can order your team member any job (in case it has necessary materials or tools.) In the camp mode each of your friends can supply with food, tools, weapons, rests and defeats in need. In any time player can change into each member of the team a direct it's acting on his own.  Every character has specified abilities and predispositions, which can be developed in different fields. Besides, staying in the team, you are much safer, because it is easier to defeat violent attacks of dangerous creatures. When the night falls it is also more dangerous – there are more threats and your companies are sleepy and less active.  Left-handed bottom part of the screen contains icons of team members. If you drag and click at the team member icon you can easily direct chosen character.   Right-handed bottom part of the screen contains icons for game operating:  Icon of an hourglass – shortcut to menu for time operating.  Icon of a palm – shortcut to menu, where you can direct your team by giving orders to other members of the team.

Our intrepid nitwit investigates interesting peculiar people, puzzling places and panicky problems along the way to saving the day, once he finally realises that something is wrong.  Expect lots of laughs and head-scratching dilemmas before you reach the shocking conclusion and find out what all this ""Million Stomping Boots"" business is actually about!  Free demo with around 45-60 minutes of gameplay available for those who want to try before they buy.   Game Details:   Classic point-and-click adventure gaming action with a few new twists Retro 320x200 resolution graphics Fully voiced  Epic music score  Plenty of puzzles  Plenty of adventure Plenty of comedy  This game has been a labour of love by 2 devs (CaptainD and TheBitPriest) - who should know better, but just can't help loving the genre - with help from multiple other people over time.   We were inspired by the classic adventure games produced by Lucasfilm Games and Sierra, and believe we have created something that will hopefully, like those games, stand the test of time.   Reviews:  "" As a light-hearted comedy adventure with a few head-scratching puzzles, any fans of Space Quest or Zac McKracken will find plenty here to enjoy."" ( The Reticule )  ""It’s everything a point and click game should be and more!"" ( X-Geeks )  ""What I loved most about this game is that it is well-written with a delightful sense of comic humor... To summarize, CaptainD and TheBitPriest have done an admirable job of creating a game that is delightful to play. "" ( Just Adventure )  ""Captain Disaster turned out to be an incredibly in-depth adventure with a world more vivid than we imagined from first impressions. "" ( BigBossBattle )  ""an absolutely bonkers, dangerous, grand adventure!"" ( Wraithkal )  ""if  you are in the mood for a good old school point and click this is a hard game to pass up.""  ( NeoRetroGo )  ""a throwback point and click adventure with a nice, comical, story"" ( The Loot Gaming )   What players have said:  ""An hilarious and fun to play spacefaring adventure, full of clever ideas and puzzles of all sorts""    ""A fun successor to games like Space Quest with references and jokes aplenty and a lighthearted atmosphere that doesn't take itself seriously in the slightest. Had a lot of fun figuring out the puzzles and meeting all the bizarre characters.""   ""If you have a fondness for planet-hopping sci-fi TV shows and movies of yesteryear, and you also like the idea of guiding a bumbling buffoon through a comedy of errors in deep space, give this game a try.""   ""A great game polished to a brilliant sheen over many years of development. Instant adventure game classic!""   ""excellent story with engaging & challenging game play with a lot of subtle social comment & brought to life with humorous voice-acting .....What more can I say!""   ""I found it to be a delightful & engaging game brought to life with an interesting story, humour that I could immediately identify with & pretty good voice acting!""

""  ""It's a very fun game with a great combination of story and mixture of some tributes to movies and games!""  ""It's Captain Disaster, a zany, outlandish comedy game that never fails to amuse.

"Captive Audience is a first person Narrative Thriller set in the confines of the Compendium Estates, a dark-web corporation responsible for the creation of unlicensed programming using unwilling participants sourced from death row.  With a focus on object interactivity, as well as a fully voice acted story complete with multiple scenes of dialogue, scoring and object commentary, Captive Audience aims to be an immersive, engaging thriller that draws the player into its world and pulls them through to the shocking conclusion.   Synopsis  Five years ago Matt's wife Julia was convicted for a crime she didn't commit, and transferred to the Compendium Estates before her conviction could be carried through.   In a desperate attempt to free her from a fate of servitude Matt attempted a rescue, only to be captured himself, imprisoned by the Compendium Estates and finding himself as the star for their latest show ""Captive Audience"".   Now, five seasons on, the intervention of a unknown forces offers a chance of escape to Matt, one he cannot pass up. Completing episodes of the show during the day, and attempting escape at night, Matt must work his way through the confines of the Compendium sound stage to free both himself and his wife.   Fully voice acted  Captive Audience is a fully voice acted experience narrated by professional actors from across the UK. We spent a lot of time ensuring we found the best people for each role, recording them in a professional grade sound studio and then mixing them into our world to make the experience more immersive.   Interact with the world  Captive Audience features numerous objects in the environment that the player can interact with, from basketballs to stuffed cows. Each items has its own unique dialogue or SFX attached to it, ensuring they feel realistic and impact to both the character and the player.   Dynamic node based story-telling system  Our unique nodular system for Captive Audience allows the story to progress in a natural and systematic way, ensuring the flow of the narrative is never interrupted so that the player really feels like a part of the show. Each episode is split into two sections, the ""Show"", where Matt is forced to complete tasks for TV, and the ""Escape"" where at night Matt works to ensure his freedom.   Detailed lighting and environments  Captive Audience makes use of Unity's lighting with the addition of volumetric systems to give the light a really weighty and realistic feel. We wanted every environment to reflect the tone of the scenario Matt finds himself in, be it a warmly lit set, or a cold, dark corridor backstage.    ***********************************************************************************  Controls:  W/A/S/D - Move E - Interact Left Mouse - Move Camera Right Mouse (Hold) - Rotate Objects Shift - Sprint  ***********************************************************************************  Please note ""Captive Audience"" is designed as a  Prototype  for a game concept and as such is likely to contain bugs, issues etc. This is  not a commercial product , but is intended to be seen as is to evaluate the concept and gameplay mechanics.

"At twilight in Kentucky, as bird songs give way to the choir of frogs and insects, familiar roads become strange, and it's easy to get lost. Those who are already lost may find their way to a secret highway winding through underground caves. The people who live and work along this highway are themselves a little strange at first, but soon seem familiar: the aging driver making the last delivery for a doomed antique shop; the young woman who fixes obsolete TVs surrounded by ghosts; the child and his giant eagle companion; the robot musicians; the invisible power company lurking everywhere, and the threadbare communities who struggle against its grip.  KENTUCKY ROUTE ZERO is a magical realist adventure game in five acts, featuring a haunting electronic score, and a suite of hymns and bluegrass standards recorded by The Bedquilt Ramblers. Rendered in a striking visual style that draws as much from theater, film, and experimental electronic art as it does from the history of videogames, this is a story of unpayable debts, abandoned futures, and the human drive to find community.  Originally published episodically over a span of years, the game now includes all five acts along with the ""interludes,"" which were originally published separately. It has also been painstakingly localized for French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and Spanish (both European Spanish and Latin American).

More importantly, can you  save your friends ?  ---Features---  High-intensity gameplay , randomized levels and hand-crafted bosses.

"""Do you remember?"" ""All those made up stories at bedtime?"" ""The one about the prince and the princess?"" ""Not the ones who fell in love...""   ""But the two that walked side by side?""  ""The Exalt of Idwall once dedicated her life to the study of Aether, but now has more pressing matters; a mutilated king, a throne that was never meant to be hers, and a man who is the last of his kind. Her story was burned to ash and the pages are all but smeared across lies and rumors. Yet, I still remember...""   Summary Aether Skies tells the story of the destruction of Idwall. A kingdom paying for their use of aether during their war of conquest. They have few allies and are in a weakened state with the recent attack on their king who was delivered to them in a blooded crate. Though he survived the assault he was deemed unfit to rule and his older sister inherited the throne. As the memoir unfolds you choose to witness the story as the inheriting Exalt or as the Scion Eir, a man who is the last of his kind haunted by aether.     Character Profiles          Gameplay Aether Skies has choice driven game-play, where you choose a character to start with. As you play the memoir not only do your choices influence one character, but both in dynamic ways. There is a default game start that each character begins with. If you choose to start the story with Eir you will make choices that influence his life. When you finish the story and go onto the Exalt's side you see how the choices you made with Eir affect Reina and provoke difference responses. You can always choose to replay with a blank slate or you can import your play through after finishing the story. The focus isn't on different endings, but on different journey to the same destruction of Idwall. The kingdom is doomed. Do you play to save one character, save each, or save the kingdom? The end results are all tied up in choices you get to choose. Features Aether Skies: Scion currently contains over 45,000 words and over 100 choices and counting. CG's in game (4 in first chapter alone) 4 Romance Options (Previews to come) An alternative reading font Choices can be selected with number keys Quick Save and Load option Progress:  Post Last Updated Oct 25, 2018 End Notes The game can be split into two different releases Aether Skies: Scion and Aether Skies: Exalt where the playable character is in the name. I'm working out the details on how to import the data from each game. Talking Points Suggestions Which is your favorite character so far?

"Explore an autumnal forest, forage for food, find a warm, dry den to make your own and prepare for winter.  Forager is a game by  Nate Gallardo  and  Cat Burton .   An important note from Cat & Nate:  We're releasing Forager in a not-entirely polished state! Unfortunately, after over a year of part-time development, we reached a point where we realised we weren't able to devote the time to it that it required to become the project we initially dreamed of. So you'll notice some rough edges, some flickering geometry, some missing sounds and so forth. That said, it's entirely playable and the the core game loop is functional, so please do check it out!  Finally, we put a lot of work into Forager, so we're going with a pay-what-you-want approach. If you do enjoy the game as it is then we'd be very grateful for any payment you feel fair, but please note that due to its unfinished state we won't be supporting the game post-release.

Innovative controls and fluid gameplay allow players to choose their own pace, whether fast as a hack'n'slash or methodic as chess.  	It's fresh gameplay to a classic genre - moving and attacking are the same thing!  	    	   	In a remote village where everyone is given a specific role, Kim was chosen as their guardian. Peace reigned for centuries, and the warrior role was a mere tradition tracing back to ancient times of conflict.  	Soon after Kim turned twelve, a distress call was sensed by her trainer - her own, adorable grandmother - who ordered her to protect the village against an impending attack	 .  	   	Kim was sent to fight without even knowing what violence was.

Keen's main innovation lies in its turn-based movement and attack mechanics.

"This is in Beta - let me know if you hit problems  Platforms  It's designed to run on browsers on PC's. It will run on mobiles/tablets but it might be slow, hard to read, and just less good, and for some reason the sound doesn't work yet. If you turn on Mobile mode in the setting menu it adds a couple of mobile affordances.  Note that while there is an auto-scaling option in the settings menu, if you're on a PC scaling the browser page usually looks nicer (ctrl + mousewheel).  Update:  there's a now a standalone windows version - it should be considered more beta (beta-er?) than the browser version. Let me know of any problems.  Instructions  On the main screen:  Choose a treasure to try and retrieve; the deeper the deadlier, but the more valuable. Select up to 3 'heroes' to delve into the dungeon.  In dungeon:  For each character in turn a selection of moves will be shown - choose with the mouse/touch. Find the treasure - it's usually deep in the dungeon. There may be clues. Then get out, and get paid.  Saving  The game automatically saves to the browser storage - so won't be available if you use a different browser or clear storage.  At the moment there are no external saves - although you can find plugins to capture/restore local browser storage.  FAQ  Hey, the game said a rude word?  Sorry, most of the names are randomly generated and might sometimes swear. Why does the Dwarven Goddess have a beard?  You answered your own question there. Hey, I found a dungeon where you can't reach the treasure.  There are several methods of bypassing walls, but they are not always practical, so I have tried to avoid generating that sort of dungeon. Press 'D' while you are in the dungeon and write down the number and let me know. Can I skip a turn?  No, sorry. Everyone is keen to get back to the tavern (see in the comments for my actual reason). Skull Traps are too deadly?  Yes, safety was not a primary consideration of the evil summoners that put them there. Remember, you can see them when you're nearby, so either go carefully or accept the risk. If you do wander into one, then the best approach is to kill one skull and run through the gap.

"The sweetness and creativity of Studio Ghibli in a Blade Runner alike setting, with the humor and game style of Monkey Island…  Those are the ingredients that inspired  ENCODYA , an indie point’n’click adventure game under development, set in a dystopian cyberpunk world.     STORYLINE  It’s 2062. Tina – a 9 years old orphan – lives with SAM-53 – her big clumsy robot guardian – on a rooftop makeshift shelter in Neo-Berlin, a dark megalopolis controlled by corporations. The protagonist is an urban jungle kid, which has learnt to live alone, scavenging dumpsters of the dystopian city, eking out a living of scraps. Her funny robot always with her, programmed to protect the girl no matter what.   KEY FEATURES  - 6+ Hours Gameplay - 2 Playable Characters - 30+ Non-Player Characters - 50+ Locations - 5000+ Lines of Dialogues - Randomization of Objects and Locations - Original Art and Assets - Custom Sound Design - Original Sound Track - Professional Voice Actors - Localization   TEAM  The game is developed by  Nicola Piovesan  and  Chaosmonger Studio . It’s the first big game project for what is usually an award winning film production company. Coming from the world of cinema and animation, however, is a quality statement for important elements that should identify a video game, such as the storyline, visual aesthetic, acting, music and sound immersion. The characters are voiced by professional voice actors, including the guest star  Richard Epcar , that you might know for being the voice of Rayden in Mortal Kombat or The Joker in several Batman games.   ABOUT ENCODYA   DOWNLOAD THE DEMO  You can test yourself the quality of  ENCODYA  by playing its  free  demo. With 1 hour gameplay, 8 NPC and the huge amount of details, it's rather a small-game than a demo!

"This game lets you try on the role of a Supernatural Newspaper Agency boss and editor. The world it takes place in is a dark and haunted one, with ghosts, zombies, monsters and even shapeshifting murderers, pretending to be human after they have stolen their victims' bodies or infiltrated the humanity. It was inspired heavily by the works of H.P.Lovecraft and it builds on the atmosphere of uncertainty and noir of the 1940s. Send your sextet of weathered journalists, detectives and occult specialists to investigate murder, affair, and horror in the Town. Each time, the story will be different. Sometimes, a werewolf is shredding innocent (and less innocent) victims to pieces and it is your task to unmask the creature. Other times, it will be a body stealing alien from outer space, a mummy that some misfortunate archeologist has excavated and is now haunting them. Perhaps it will be Jack the Ripper, still mysteriously alive and lurking in the streets at night. Or maybe there is a really bad big tentacled monster hidden in the cellar of the University?

"Build a hive, make some honey! Hive Time is a small, bee themed management/base building sim. Harvest resources, grow your hive, and produce a new Queen before the current one dies.  Manage different bee roles in a totally scientifically inaccurate depiction of hive dynamics. Send Foragers out to find pollen and nectar, have Builders research new cell types, and ensure you have enough Beesitters to raise the next generation of bees.  Make interesting choices that affect the hive. Respond to wasp attacks, deal with outlaw slugs, or help a caterpillar realise a lifelong dream!  Hive Time's original soundtrack is available  on Bandcamp .   FAQ (click to expand)   Is this game free?  I believe that the effort we have put into creating and supporting Hive Time is worth at least $10. However, I also believe that in an ideal world, financial barriers should never prevent people from participating in culture. For this project, I'm in a position to make the game available under a pay-what-you-want model so that it can be accessible to people who can't afford $10.  If you can afford $10, but would prefer to not pay, that's up to you, but I hope that if you find enjoyment in the game that you'll come back to give some support that matches that enjoyment.  Similarly, Peter has released  Hive Time's original soundtrack on Bandcamp  under a pay-what-you-want model.  - Cheese    Is this game finished?  We consider Hive Time to be a complete game.  In the weeks and months following release, we plan to ship some small patches and larger updates, but the game's mechanics, style, and identity reflect what we wanted to make and are not likely to change.

Technical help  If you're experiencing troubles, please send a detailed description of what is occurring along with relevant save files and logs to  support [AT] jbushproductions.com  Common technical hurdles and how to cross them:   No text is visible outside of the main menu  This occurs when the game is unable to load fonts (the main menu text is actually a 3D model!).  The most common cause of this is the game being unable to find the  fonts  folder. Please make sure that it is extracted into the same folder as the game's executable (.x86_64, .exe) and that the  working folder  is set to the same location when running the game.  If you're not feeling confident extracting the game properly or are still experiencing problems, consider playing Hive Time through the  Itch.io App , which handles all of that for you.     Sound suddenly becomes garbled or stutters  When under high load, the Godot engine's sound server can become unstable and cause the rest of the game to lag.  Typically, this is caused by the  Bee Sound Count  setting in the Audio settings menu being too high. The default value of 25 seems to be appropriate for most systems that the game has been tested on, but  lower may be more appropriate for your computer .  When this occurs,  the game will typically need to be restarted  in order for audio to return to normal.     As my hive gets big, the game's frame rate slowly declines  During development, I made the decision to not put a performance oriented maximum cap on hive or population size, so generally speaking, it will always be possible to make a hive that's too big for your computer to handle. The game should still be playable at a low frame rate, and spawning a new Queen doesn't specifically require a large hive, so  it's up to you to play within the constraints of what you're comfortable with .  The game's minimum requirements are based on running the game with  Shadows ,  Anti-alising , and  Depth Of Field  settings all  disabled , and with the  Bee Sound Count  audio setting set to  zero . These options can have a big impact on performance.  If you find that sound is garbled or stuttering, please refer to the "" Sound suddenly becomes garbled or stutters "" section.    Current known issues:   Keyboard bindings with modifiers that share primary keys with other bindings (eg: Ctrl+S and S) may behave unexpectedly     Gameplay tips  There's a lot to keep track of in Hive Time! Part of the fun is in exploring and learning how different systems work. Generally, the impact of your actions takes a little while to be apparent, so observing after experimenting can be important!  Here are a couple of tips that might point you in the right direction if you're feeling stuck:   What can I do to stop my bees from dying out?  Beesitter bees  are  critical  for positive population growth. If your hive's  Beesitters  start to decline, there may not be enough of them left to replace the current  Beesitter  population, which can lead to the hive's entire population dying out.  Finding the right  balance  for your hive's current needs is important, and that balance needs to be generous enough to not be upset by  small fluctuations . Responding quickly to  events  that impact the hive's population is important as well. Sometimes  you might need to overcompensate  in order to get to where you want to be or to prevent a disaster.  Keep in mind that each  role-specific cell  increases the  population capacity  for the relevant bee role. When a role population is  over capacity , bees of that role will  only live half as long .     Why do I keep running out of resources?  Several things influence resource dynamics.  Resources are consumed  in the production of  Wax ,  Honey , and  Jelly , while the accumulation of  Nectar  and  Pollen  is dependent on  foraging .  The chart on the  Resources screen  (accessible from any storage cell) allows the increase and decline of multiple resources to be viewed at once. If production of a particular resource is consuming too much of another resource, temporarily  pausing  the relevant production facilities may help.  Foraging requires enough  Exit cells  for the  Worker  and  Forager  populations to leave the hive (as explained in the in-game tutorial, each cell can only support three working bees at once). The  Activity screen  (accessible from the  Upgraded Throne Room ) can help highlight when portions of the Forager or Worker populations are  idle  and unable to gather resources.  Foragers  are able to collect for more resources than  Workers , so a healthy Forager population with enough  Exits  and  Map Rooms  for them to lead full, productive lives can increase  Nectar  and  Pollen  collection greatly.  Making use of the  pollination  options in the  Foraging screen  (accessible from any  Map Room )and selecting pollinated  foraging zones  can also provide a boost to foraged resources.     How can I make sure I have enough resources to do stuff without pausing production all the time?  Upgraded storage cells unlock "" reserve "" sliders that can be adjusted from the  Resources screen  (accessible from any storage cell).  Resource reserves put a minimum limit on stock levels before production can happen, keeping the remaining resources spare for you to spend on construction or research!     How do cell upgrades work?  Cell upgrades  are an action that can be performed on  existing non-upgraded cells .  Each cell type (except for Exit cells) has its own pattern or  cluster of non-upgraded cells  that are required in order to be upgraded.  For example,  Upgraded Workshops  only require a  single non-upgrade Workshop cell , while all  upgraded storage cells  require a  cluster of seven non-upgraded cells  of the  same type .",Simulation,bee||City Builder||Cute||Hex Based||hive||Management,Hive Time,cheeseness.itch.io/hive-time

"Welcome me Hearties to Gentlemen of Fortune: Maelstrom  This download offers three sets of executables:  DirectX9 - 64 bit, DirectX9 - 32 bit, DirectX 8 - 32 bit.  By themselves, they provide nothing to play, but each of the versions can play the following, freely available mods and derivatives:  Buccaneers of the Caribe  (based on Pirates of the Caribbean) New Horizons  (from  Pirates Ahoy!  community) Caribe Stories  (based on Caribbean Tales) Caribe Stories Historical Immersion  (based on Caribbean Tales) Lost Ships City  (based on City of Abandoned Ships) Gentlemen of Fortune 1.2 Gentlemen of Fortune 2.0 Gentlemen of Fortune 2.5 Historical ERAS II  Anyone who has played the above games, knows the frustration with the originals; rife with game-breaking bugs and frequent crashes.  No more!  We have overhauled the code, eliminating the vast memory leaks and crash-inducing bugs.  In addition, we have improved the performance, and also upgraded from the original DirectX 8 (despite the claim on the COAS box, any process explorer showed the game was never actually running DirectX 9).  Also now provide a 64 bit, for systems using that architecture (though even without, all the same fixes were applied to our DX8 and 32 bit versions, so older systems can still benefit).  Some other improvements are the swapping out of Windows memory allocation routines, in favor of a famous, more efficient method that increases allocation speed, improves efficiency and reduces fragmentation.   FMOD , for sound, is updated to the most current and the engine implementation of it completely rewritten for new features.  Fixed fullscreen task-switching bug that crashed game, to actually allow fullscreen and task/window switching in/out of game without a problem.  Deprecated DDRAW for video has been removed and updated with something newer.  Save-file compression routine updated (still compatible for old saves, only in GOF, COAS and ERAS 2).  Corrected multi-threading of sea calc routines.  Changed to asynch system/trace logging.  Now with built in options to control video adapter selection, VSynch, Triple Buffering, and Antialiasing.  Various features were added to support further mod capabilities, notably seen in  ERAS II , and things like improved ship AI within the engine itself.  These are just a few of the long list of improvements/fixes developed over the last couple years that have been most graciously beta-tested by some forum members over at  https://buccaneersreef.com .  Original Base Game: AGE OF PIRATES 2 – City of Abandoned Ships; Licensing sold and owned by other third party(s). Original Source Code (freeware) which ran in DirectX 8 was given away freely eight years ago and completely rebuilt and overhauled by the Buccaneer's Reef Team. This is completely new source code which is now capable of running all the older games based on POTC (Storm 2.0) and Caribbean Tales (Storm 2.5), plus the newer based on City of Abandoned Ships (Storm 2.8), but now in DirectX 9 and 64 bit, if desired, to which all rights are reserved by the Buccaneer's Reef Team and official legal licensing pending.

This game is inspired by Dangan Ronpa, Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney, and Layton Brothers! (Three of my favorite murder mystery games!)   Put simply, Seven Photos is a murder mystery game where you have 7 photos to figure out exactly how and why you woke up, without memories, outside a locked room containing two presumably dead people.  This is a point and click, action thriller game in which you try to figure out who the murderer is before you go insane. Could it have been you? Who's lying? You have seven photos to figure that out.   Gameplay  Point and click:  -Look for evidence by clicking around for them! Drag to shoot evidence bullets: -When you get to the countering phase, drag to shoot the evidence bullet at the statement that you can prove wrong with that evidence! -(ex. if you have a evidence bullet that says you 'love dogs more than cats', if a statement says 'you love cats more than dogs' you would prove that statement wrong by using your 'love dogs' bullet! If you love Dangan Ronpa, you'll see that this mechanic pays homage to the classic 'You've got that wrong'! from that game :)  Also, I threw in some references to Dangan Ronpa, Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney, and Layton Brothers within the game if you want to find those!  Let me know if you guys find bugs and enjoy!

The game pays homage to a time where video games were allowed to be difficult. It is best described as a crossover between Sonic the Hedgehog and Super Meat Boy - with the level design of Super Mario... and the control scheme of Angry Birds?!  The premise is simple, move the ball with your mouse. However, with 360 degrees of options, varying speeds, and moving terrain, the movement itself becomes a puzzle. Even the smallest challenge becomes difficult when you just can't seem to stand still!

Deep down in the dark deep depths of darkness, the robot uprising looms. More and more of your precious mine is slowly getting taken over by these pesky fiends. Can you change the course of destiny? Will you get to the bottom of this mystery? Will you stop the robots from conquering the world? Or will you roll past and ignore the entire story we spent countless hours writing? :(  Either way, good luck!

"The Space Between  by  Christoph Frey  is a surreal short narrative experience in three acts about the walls we build for us. The architect Martin Melanson, commissioned to build a theater, meets a woman named Clara, outside of his apartment complex at night. Attracted to each other, they visit the theater's building site. While they explore the unfinished stage, surrounded by scaffolds and lost in thoughts, reality slowly fades, where the curtain opens and a dark play about closeness and separation begins. The game's drawn-out, static nature, embedded in blurred PS1 visuals, supports its surreal plot and dialogues to create a dreamlike 40 - 50 minute experience, that should be played in one sitting.

"Named one of the 10 best indie games of 2019 by  PAX ,  The Devil's Calculator  is a non-profit, educational maths experience masquerading as a casual puzzle, featuring levels by some of the world's leading mathematicians including bestselling author and Guardian puzzle editor  Alex Bellos ,  Grant Sanderson  of the highly popular 3Blue1Brown YouTube channel, Numberphile's  James Grime  and many others. The game was named a fan favorite of GDWC,  is a shortlisted for a TIGA award and was celebrated at the MOVES conference by the National Museum of Mathematics in New York City.   An evil calculator has its normal arithmetic operators replaced with sadistically obscure functions. Based on machine learning concepts, players interpolate these functions  using sophisticated logic and reverse engineering. Rather than the typical scenario of ""solving for X"" in algebra, the operators themselves are a mystery. To calculate your perpetual goal of  666 , you must strategically collect data and recognize patterns in the output of the calculator. Advanced graphing mechanics and deep integration with professional tools such as Wolfram and Weka help you in your journey and make the experience accessible, not mathematically erudite.  An in-depth level creation system for sharing with the online community guarantees hours of challenging and rewarding gameplay well after the main campaign.",Puzzle||Educational||Strategy,Casual||Experimental||GitHub||Level Editor||Math||Multiplayer||pax10,The Devil's Calculator,cinqmarsmedia.itch.io/devilscalc

"Senbir is a “game”. Sorta. More than anything, it’s a sandbox with a fully-featured virtual computer, but it does include some short tutorial levels to help guide you all the way to building a simple bootloader that can run a program (read: a win screen) off your disk. That’s all well and good, you might be thinking to yourself, “but how does it fit in with the theme?”  ABOUT  Your computer only has 128 bytes of RAM. That’s 32 memory addresses (1 address = 4 bytes) in RAM. Your programs have to fit into 32 addresses or less. Your drive is bigger (1024 bytes in 256 addresses), but by no means the end-all be-all of storage. This is all REAL SIMULATION, too. You’re writing actual assembly (and by extension, bytecode) for the virtual TC-06 processor that lives in your computer. You can, in theory, make  anything . You have a monitor - data port 0. You can read from it and write to it. A harddrive, port 1. Read and write access. A keyboard, port 2. Even a mouse in port 3.   You've been given an old TC-06 based home computer and some hardware to go with it.  Your gifter gave you a goal: load a program from the included harddrive and run it.  The main actual  game  section is a series of four levels/tutorials guiding you through some of the assembly language, up to the grand finale of writing a ""BIOS"" that will load the win screen program off the disk.  Just don't run out of space!  Beyond that point, you're free to do whatever.  You can try to program something in that tiny amount of space, or if that’s all a little too restrictive for you, then there  is  an Extended mode that gives you 1kB of RAM & an 8kB drive, as well as a Custom mode that lets you pick pretty much every number yourself.   There's also an official Discord server up - it requires manual verification for posting permissions to be added, so if you join in the middle of the night, there's a chance you won't be able to be able to post for a bit. Please don't spam, be respectful, etc - basically, just read everything in #rules. (Temporary thing: in light of recent bad actors engaging in Discord data-scraping, the server widget is hereby *disabled*.  Post on the forums if you need a manual invite.)   RISC-06   As seen in WINE.  RISC-06 is a spinoff of the TC-06 processor architecture designed to be super-low-fi.  I made it mainly as an experiment to learn how to do a C++ library (the VM seen here is powered by a general library) for later use in Senbir itself (a C++ TC-06 will have  ALL THE PROCESSING SPEED ) and it came out pretty nice.  You can download the RISC-06 IDE from this page, which gives you a full-featured development environment with a basic assembler, debug tools, integrated VM, and manual.  It's all very WIP and experimental, so expect things to change & explode a lot. Install instructions Extract the ZIP and run the executable within.  Alternatively, if you got it via the Itch app (which I highly recommend), you should just be able to run it like normal.

"Concrete Jungle is a new take on the city building genre that swaps micro-management for a more strategic and puzzle-orientated style of city planning.   You have a deck of selected cards which you can use to place buildings. Each building will affect it's surroundings in different ways. The aim of the game is to clear city blocks by gathering the required number of points from your residents, giving more room to build. As the city grows, bigger and better new buildings can be added to your deck!   As you get opportunities to hone and refine your deck, residents will demand more from you. You'll find yourself inadvertently creating zoning puzzles- playing against your own past planning decisions.   Alternatively engage in competitive city planning against challenging AI or local players. Take it in turns to place buildings in the same city and battle over the affection of your citizens!

"CONTROLS  AWSD to move SHIFT to sprint E to interact TAB for audio menu  GENERAL NOTES  [Note on performance: The web build may only work (or at least, work well) on higher end machines. I've done my best to make it playable in browsers, but if that isn't working, the standalone builds should run better. At least the Windows one should. Mac and Linux builds are unfortunately (again) untested...]  This is a game which started with an unrealistic scope and got larger over the course of development. It began as a story about fantasies, grew into a critique of meritocracy and accumulation, then became a melancholy late-capitalist walking-sim, and now I'm not really sure what it is. Because of its shifting focus and my shifting interests, I've been very tempted to abandon the project. Instead, I'm releasing it it in a rough (but roughly complete) form, mostly so that I'll feel less guilty about moving on to new projects. Hopefully people will find some of it interesting, especially now that expectations have been suitably deflated...

"What is New Lethes?  	New Lethes is an experimental first person exploration game based on Situationist theory. The Situationists were a group of European intellectuals, loosely associated from the 1950s to the 1970s. Their early work focussed on the ways in which environments can subtly influence behaviour, and reproduce power relations. New Lethes explores these ideas.   	 Additional Information   	New Lethes was created by a single independent game developer, Colestia (with thanks to St Gulik). Contact me at colestia3@gmail.com, or on Twitter  @colestia3 .   Press  'Beauty is in the street. The Situationists knew this. They were also aware that power structures have always been embedded in the urban tissue and yet were cunning enough to employ play and exploration and the hijacking of art and space as tools of understanding and change. And now, many years after the death of Guy Debord, a game has been released to remind us of those brilliantly wild ideas and practices. It's called New Lethes and it will delight itself in letting you explore its experimental environment as it examines the role of the built environment in human life.' -  Konstantinos Dimopoulos, Indiegames.com  'The architecture of the city was targeted by the Situationists as a prevalent means by which capitalism held a grip over people. As  On Dérive  demonstrated, it can be used to steer us physically through spaces, acting as a singular mass of singular thought—all of us easy to control and manipulate in service of the elite. This is what you see when  New Lethes  opens up, all those people walking the same path, dull and grey. In order to turn ""the whole of life into an exciting game"" the Situationists worked against what dérive exposed, and so must you in  New Lethes , with a view to aimlessly wander the tiny labyrinth of city streets that no one else does. You must deliberately work against designs supposedly greater than you. You must dare to get lost.' -  Chris Priestman, KillScreen  If you have any comments/thoughts, feel free to get in touch via email at colestia3@gmail.com or on Twitter  @colestia3 .

"On 1 December 1948, a body was found on Somerton Beach in Adelaide, Australia. From there unfolded one of the most perplexing (and still unsolved) mysteries of the 20th century.  This game seeks to recreate the experience of the 1948-1949 investigation. It is the first in a series (hopefully?) where I go back over miscellaneous ideas I've had for games over the past five or so years, using them as a starting point for experiments in form and design.  I completed this game in less than 72 hours, so don't expect a comprehensive recreation of the case. In particular, the game intentionally excludes information and theories that arose after 1949. If you want more detail on the case, there are a heap of sources available, but the  Wikipedia article  is fairly comprehensive as is 'The Unknown Man' by G M Feltus (if you can find a copy).

You have promised a strange ghost that you met in a junkyard to grow a flower for her, and return it to her when it blossoms. As you learn how to care for a flower, your girlfriend is eager to spend time with you. What you do is your choice. There are no 'wrong' choices in this twine story.

"Bronze Age is a hybrid city builder / 4X currently in development. Starting with a small village, your task is to grow it into a thriving city. Managing resource production, defenses, and trade, you can expand your city into  a mighty empire.  City Building  Cities are the foundation of your empire. The citizens must be fed and housed, and in return they can produce all the resources you'll need. Fail to meet their needs, however, and you may end up with rioters in the streets.  Beyond the basics of resource production, however, you need to consider roads and defenses. Do you spend the time and resources to construct a great wall around your city? Do you rely on your soldiers alone? The streets themselves will become battlefields when you are invaded, so take care when designing them.  Empire Building  As your city grows you can start sending some of its citizens out to create new cities. These cities can then be linked together through trade routes, spreading rare resources throughout your empire.   Known Issues  There is one major known issue. Some people have reported graphical problems, this appears to be linked to AMD video cards.

"In a certain country during the late 20th century, a series of strange deaths occurred. All of the victims were found with their bodies putrefied, even though they shouldn't have died more than a few hours ago. This, however, stopped as quickly as it had come, only to be replaced by a series of strange disappearances. The government tried to hush it up, because they had no leads – to no avail. The powerful Wilshire Corporation continued to keep tabs on the case, while at the same time a secret private detective group went on a manhunt for the perpetrator. These cases closed upon the unfortunate deaths of said group in an accident. Years passed. All was well.  All was well, until the decaying corpse of Mikaela Lane turned up at the back of an abandoned church.  This story is set a year after that – about a young female corporate mercenary, Sho Reilen, who is skilled in the use of swords. She has something she wants – to confront Kaison Voltaire, a young man who seeks to hunt her down in revenge for the death of his beloved friend, Mikaela.  Crimson Rafflesia  is a story about truth and lies, love and hate, and a field of decaying flowers.  _________________________________________  Genre:  Supernatural, Thriller, Horror, Romance, Psychological  Rating:  Teen (13+), for dark themes, blood and violence.  _________________________________________    ""You owe me your life, you said. Then I suppose it's alright for me to collect my debt now?""  A crazed, villainous, cheerful child with no conscience – quite a despicable person and seeks pleasure in ruining others. With a terrible personality like that, she certainly has made herself a lot of enemies, but then again, it's hard to tell what she wants, or what she is thinking.   ""I'm so sorry. I'm a murderer, you see?""  Kaison Voltaire is a 17-year-old boy whose father was a fencer. When he was 12, he got into an accident involving a fall which messed up many of his memories – in that hospital was where he first met Mikaela.   ""Dear Diary, … I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's my fault. It's my fault. It's my fault…""  A close friend of Kaison's, whom he had known ever since they were children. A girl with corn-yellow hair and a delightful smile, whom he remembered well. The girl who saved his life. Who is now deceased – no, murdered. Murdered by Sho Reilen, who had the audacity to laugh, ""It was a whim, a whim. I killed her on a whim. Is that a good enough answer for you?""   ""All good things in the world will end someday. Let us end this one with a good show.""  The son of Wilshire Corporation's director, and Sho's (current) employer. He has a strong sense of duty, but is also as cut-throat merciless as his job dictates. His father was a passionate leader who managed to bring his company to a flourishing state in this utter ruin of a country in a mere few decades.   ""That is why, Kaison. I want you to be fully aware of what you are getting yourself into.""  A kind, gentle priestess of the Temple of Holy Light. Calm, tranquil and dignified, she hides more than people think. After all, she does possess the charisma to attract even non-believers to this strange little temple of hers.   ""Being part of this kind family, I can't ask for anything more.""  Shirley Primer is Aurelia's 17-year-old younger sister. A soft-spoken and kindhearted girl, she was, however, caught in an accident in her youth that left her wheelchair-bound. She is a sickly girl who's recently been hospitalized again from a psychosomatic eye injury, from which she is recovering. Kaison seems to find her familiar, somehow.   ""Ah, tea is just coffee without caffeine, right? Gotcha.""  Layner is a young coffee shop boy. He frequently has his head in the clouds, not being able to take anything seriously, if anything at all. The dilapidated little excuse of a coffee shop he maintains is supposedly listed under his parents' names, but he takes care of it all by himself. He seems to know Mikaela Lane, but knows nothing of the true events behind her death, or any of the secrets behind it. After all, he's just an ordinary boy, seventeen years old, looking forward to the prospect of adulthood…   Original Artwork Original Music (Main Theme and Arrangements) Multiple points of view Make choices and play as both Sho and Kaison 20+ endings in the full version 20+ CGs in the demo  If you are interested in the demo, please consider giving a small donation to our Patreon so that the full game can become a reality soon!  https://www.patreon.com/soyasushi?ty=h&u=211030",Visual Novel||Interactive Fiction,Dating Sim||Dystopian||Horror||Multiple Endings||Mystery||Otome||renpy||Romance,Crimson Rafflesia,coren.itch.io/crimson-rafflesia

"Lead as queen of a bee colony!  Start a hive near flowers, lay eggs, and set the jobs of your expanding force of worker bees. Workers can forage flowers for nectar and pollen, nurse the brood, build new hive cells, and defend the hive from wasps and other players.  How to Play: Press and hold where you want to go, and the queen bee will head there. Place a hive with the 'new hive' button to place new hive cells. Press a nearby hive cell to select it. Place eggs there with the 'lay egg' button. Press one of your own workers to select them. Choose their job from the buttons below them. Foragers gather pollen and bring it to empty hive cells. Nurses bring collected pollen to your brood (which then become pupae, then birth as new workers), and builders eat honey and build new hive cells. Press attack to toggle alarm pheromones in your workers. They will attack wasps, the nearest enemy bees, and player queens.

Excerpt:  NARRATOR Huddling in the corner of our modest shop I can see them. I can see them through the glass, weaving to and fro as if only held upright by the merest of threads invisibly dangling from the hazy sky. The light that had previously consumed their retinas has faded to a dull glow. For hours I have hovered inside my shop. Waiting. Watching. My wife and I had chosen the reflective lettering on the glass of our shop in an attempt to catch the eyes of passerby to peruse our wares. I do not understand why, but it seems to confuse them. Almost immediately on turning to the glass the light in their eyes will fade, and they will either stand idly, waiting, or join the ranks of the others. A sudden scream shatters my thoughts and I slowly stand and walk toward the glass pane. A lone woman runs screaming through the street. YOU (horrified) No…No! NARRATOR As soon as I speak one of the Listless turns toward the window and I press myself against the wall in terror. It weaves to and fro in indecisive consternation, its ears aware of sound but the mirrored letters confusing its vision. After a few moments it turns back towards the woman. By the time I work up enough nerve to return to the glass and try to help, it is too late. But the Listless aren’t even the worst part. The dust.

Rules  There are two types of cards in the game:   Planets create resources and add special abilities. Ships are for attack and defense. They can be placed in front of planets to protect the planet from attacks.   Pick one of four races with different abilities:  Humans  (Image above - bottom):  Extra ship production Extra firepower Powerful AOE damage Ship upgrades  Shokarr  (Image above - top):  Cloaked ships & planets. Cloaked ships can pass by defenders and directly attack planets Have traps & decoys  Mazaz  (Image below - top):  Recharging shilds on ships & planets EMP to disable enemy ships before attacking Shield upgrades for common ships  Krrkrk  (Image below - bottom):  Growing insects swarms that get stronger over time Hives that automatically create new swarms Planets that defend themselves   You win the game by destroying the enemy home planet!  How you get new cards  To get new cards you have to research them. Therefore you need Science:   You gain science in two ways:  1. Win training matches vs the AI:   You gain more science when winning against higher AI levels.  2. Win matches in online play:   You gain 100 science for winning an online match. Additionaly you get a science bonus for playing fast.  You research new cards by spending science points:    Card prices vary based on the card type (there are two types: base & special) and how many instances of the card you already own.    Also all cards get more expensive the more you totaly own.   Due to this mechanc you will be able to quickly compose your dreamdeck.

Once she is booted up, she is given a task by the professor to learn about the many different emotions both humans and non-humans share. However, she won't be alone on her mission. Join Saturday and her two siblings as they wander throughout the ""city that never sleeps"" and meet new and mysterious faces along the way! Make friends, help out the fellow citizens of the city, and unlock mysteries and secrets that are hiding within the concrete jungle! 	 	How many emotions will you find on your trip? Who will you encounter? What things will you learn? 	 It's time to get curious!  This is just a  demo , as there will be later builds and an eventual full release in the future.   There are possibilities that there might be bugs in the game, so please report it to me if you spot any! Once again, I repeat,  this is just a demo .

The story will have a common beginning, but once you pick your bachelor of choice each story will be unique. Right now there are  five planned bachelors , with possibly  two more  depending on how long everything takes. With the fact that each route is totally different in mind (and therefore multiplying the amount of writing that needs to be done), right now the plan is to release the game in increments. For example, when the first two bachelors are done, I'll do a first release. Then probably additional releases after each one is done. I'll have to look into the details. But, there are only two of us working on this game, so please be patient with us. We would love to hear from you!

"Inna is 22 and a social recluse with a most unusual skillset: assassination. Under pressure of changing her ways, she takes on an assignment very different from what's she's accustomed to. Her new job requires her to look out for a 17-year-old girl while she is in college. What sounded like an easy piece of work – with the plus of turning over a new leaf – turns out to be quite the predicament for Inna... in more than one way. This release features 3 complete endings, and 1 ongoing one. Inna Antonova : The protagonist.  Inna generally avoids social interactions, save for the ones with her contacts and clients. Contrary to her ""cold"" professional image, when relaxing at home she could be mistaken for any other regular 22-year-old girl. Lillian Garland : The romantic interest.  Lillian is a 17-year-old, outgoing college girl with a stubborn streak that she most likely inherited from her father, a successful lawyer. Samuil Atonov : Inna's adoptive father. Currently in the hospital, his health waning with each passing day. He's the main reason why Inna feels compelled to change her ways. Ray Garland : Lillian's father. A well-known and ambitious lawyer. He's rarely home, but when he is he tries to make up for lost time by spending lavishly on Lillian. Mel : Inna's primary contact for work opportunities. A mysterious, brusque man with a mind for business. He appears to have some shady connections.

starfish to use circles instead of squares, so they are consistent  regardless of orientation- Changed the last part of screen 2-4 to make it more clear that you need to jump before dashingv1.01-

"Out now!  Of Gods and Men: The Daybreak Empire  is a turn-based strategy RPG in the pixel art retro style of classic tactical games from the 90s and early 00s. We’ve mixed unit-based tactical combat, overworld territory management, and a rich story-driven campaign in a unique fantasy world.  The story follows Saaga, the leader of a backwater kingdom of the edge of Tamira disillusioned with her place in a world of people governed by the whims of bored gods and greedy lords. But when a general from the mainland comes to her begging for help, a chain of events is set off leading her on a path of war and diplomacy to create the greatest empire the world has ever seen.  This is the first full game from Dead Genre Studios, a Vancouver based indie team founded in 2017.  Features  Quick time event combat 3 base unit types with combat advantages and weaknesses 12 unique factions, with 12 unique units A campaign map with 55 unique maps Territory management, unit creation, and army movement on the campaign map A unique cast of heroes, villains, and everything in between A world rich in flavour and lore A unique soundtrack blending acoustic instruments with retro chiptunes  How To Play  This game is played on PC with the mouse and keyboard. UI elements, units, and territories can be interacted with using the left mouse button. The escape key is used to exit windows and undo unit moves in battle.  From the campaign map, you can select your territories to either command the armies on them or to upgrade and create various buildings used for producing gold and units. Upgrading financial buildings increases their gold yield, and upgrading military buildings increases the starting level of units produced with that building. Each faction has its own special building which, in addition to producing gold, can produce a unique special unit.  When you move your army into a territory you do not control, you either take control of it if it’s empty, or trigger a battle if an enemy army is present. From the battle map, you first place your units as you wish on the 8 spawn nodes available on either side of the map. Once you've passed this phase, players take turn commanding their units across the field of battle.   Unit classes follow a basic advantage system:  Archers beat infantry  Infantry beat cavalry  Cavalry beat archers  Various special units can surmount this system.",Strategy,Pixel Art||Retro||Story Rich||Strategy RPG||Tactical||Turn-based||Turn-based Strategy,Of Gods and Men: The Daybreak Empire,deadgenre.itch.io/daybreakempire

"Deep in the forest lives a spooky sorceress known only to the nearby townsfolk as the “Red Bean Witch”. Feared by many, she is believed to be summoning great dark magic when the occasional boom rattles the windows and eardrums of anyone nearby. In an attempt to spare themselves, the villagers venture into the woods to scatter bones as an offering.   What the town doesn’t know is that these terrible explosions are necessary to realising the Red Bean Witch’s true desire: to construct the most elaborate magical puzzles this world has ever known! Also, her loyal dog, Choco, sometimes runs out of bones.  Witchy Workshop is a physics-based puzzle game where you help solve the Red Bean Witch’s puzzles as her dog, Choco. This Windows release features a limited number of parts and premade puzzles, similar to a demo. Subsequent releases are slated to include sandbox puzzle building and sharing, improved elemental simulation, more types of magic, animals, additional magical and non-magical parts, and the “Ultimate Woof Power”, Choco’s secret weapon.  Features  A variety of parts magical, alchemical, and mechanical!  Conveyor belts and crossbows mingle with gemstones and crystal balls. Setting off fireworks with a candle might normally be a bad idea, but in the Workshop's noble pursuit of puzzle-solving, there's  no such thing  as a bad idea!  Lots of puzzles! Tutorial puzzles help you learn about the magic and machines of the Workshop - then test your skills in 30+ puzzles over three levels of difficulty!!  Learn about parts with the Codex The Codex has a descriptive page for every part in the game, alongside the Red Bean Witch's comments. Don't know what mandrake juice could possibly be useful for? Me either, but  she  knows!  Accessibility and performance in mind Witchy Workshop supports resolutions all the way down to 640x480, runs well on old machines, and has performance and accessibility options, such as disabling animated elements and toggling  piece outlines. An accessibility report is available on our website (also linked below, under ""More Information"").  You can be a dog that solves puzzles Most games don't do this!   Donations  This release of Witchy Workshop is free, but donations received will go toward recouping two years of late-night-programming snack runs, website and development costs (including the development of future updates and games), some recent vet bills, and maybe a bottle of wine.

"Songs of the Eons (SotE) will be a living, sandbox-style fantasy world simulator wherein the player influences the fate and evolution of a society through the eons.  SotE is currently in version 0.1.9  The roadmap SotE wiki SotE subreddit  The world of SotE will be teeming with life. The civilized races (humans, elves, dwarves and the like) carve their way through--- or adapt--- to the wilderness, transforming it to their own needs and vision. But beyond the pale light of civilization, monsters and barbarians alike feed, breed, and seek habitat in all the many multitudes of dark places on the map. Like the hungry beasts that they are, they nibble at the borders of civilization, forever threatening to overtake it and return the achievements of advanced societies to ruins and dust.  SotE is a post 4X game. It attempts to overcome the stereotypical 4X genre by introducing realistic systems of ecology and economics as a basis for evolving societies and an evolving world. While there are the familiar vestiges of eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate, SotE breaks free of the frantic race against evenly matched opponents that most 4X games force their players to participate in. Most 4X games are about achieving irreversible improvements both technologically and economically, but in SotE, a remote mountain valley civilization may just as well outlast that highly advanced continental empire over yonder. In a game where decay mechanics are just as robust as growth mechanics, a society guided toward resiliency might easily outlast the society that is geared toward rapid expansion, its technologies lost, its deeds and monuments forgotten after collapsing violently beneath its own weight.  In an eternal game world where the decline or catastrophic collapse of civilizations are as common as their rise to prominence, the player is rewarded for taking their own time and inventing their own objectives in a system with an infinite combination of civilization types. There is no victory conditions, only the songs - each unique - sung by your society as it rises and falls through the eons.  All the mechanics of SotE will be true to life. Not only will SotE take inspiration from real ecology, economics, warfare and governance, it will seek to replicate them. Civilized societies colonize and transform the land around them, making it more suitable for themselves while the wilderness persistently weathers at it, as though threatening to wash it back to the sea. Along with an authentic economic growth system, societies participate in true and dynamic trade, taking into consideration supply, demand, and costs of transaction related to distance, terrain, and banditry. Warfare will take into account the real world limitations of supply, morale, and the oft overlooked subject of what kind of men and materials are available in a society. When you govern, you will not be some all-knowing God King micromanaging the day to day work schedule of every citizen, but instead be the ruling agency of your society with limited power, capable of influencing and directing the activities of your people but not dominating them.  These are just a few of the simulated systems slated for SotE, and when combined together, they will create emergent game-play where decisions cascade through society with predictable but sometimes unexpected results. The joy in SotE will be in the player's freedom to experiment, and how that experimentation will contribute to the rise - or decline - of your civilization.  Songs of the Eons is currently at version 0.1: ""Muspelheim.""   Current features include:   A complex plate tectonic system which generates geologic features along plate boundaries similar to what one encounters in the real world, generates hotspots, and includes many other geologic features.  A climate system that considers the topography of the world and influences weather patterns.  Rainfall, surface water movement, temperature distributions, and erosion which is influenced by the topography of the world and climate.  The ability to alter dozens of variables related to world generation including the speed and frequency of tectonic plates, volcanic activity, the frequency of historic orogeny, and more.  Complex water body system with interconnected rivers, lakes, and seas.  Each water body has its own unique characteristics based geology and hydrogeology.  No two water bodies are alike.  Detailed soils which track soil texture, fertility, and soil depth.  These factors heavily influence vegetation growth and farming.  Soils are produced by numerous forces, such as glaciers, water flow via rivers and streams, wind, and chemical and physical weathering.   Our ultimate goal is to build numerous layers of simulation using each prior layer as a foundation.  Version 0.2 will construct ecology and carrying capacity of the land, version 0.3 will generate biomes and animal populations, version 0.4 will involve animal migration and rudimentary population, and so on.  In the end, we aspire to base our grand strategy game atop the living world of Songs of the Eons.

"Welcome to the  Autonauts  Prototype! We haven't updated it since the end of 2017 and have no plans to do anything else with it, but here it remains for posterity (or a crude introduction to what the game's about).  If you're interested in more, click the image below to be taken to the full release on Steam!  PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT  Please don't post about  the Steam version  here, not when there's such a lovely space to do that in the  Autonauts Steam Community . This itch.io space is dedicated to the prototype only. Cheers!     •••  The latest stable  Autonauts   prototype  is 21.2, with or without lighting depending on your video card :)   The Change Log for all versions to date can be viewed  HERE .  Who or what are the Autonauts?  The 'Automationauts' (to give them their fuller, granderer, longerwindederer title) travel the universe with the sole goal of setting worlds in motion through the power of automation.  They harness whatever natural resources are available; they learn fast and can eventually make pretty much anything from anything. But their most important creations are workerbots, which can be made from the crudest of materials and taught to do anything an Autonaut can do so they can get on with helping species evolve.  + + + AUTOWORK IN AUTOPROGRESS + + +  This pre-pre-pre-Alpha release is lacking refinement and presentation - and it can take some getting into - but under the rough edges there's a great example of what we're doing and where we're going. If you like what you see, play and automate here,  check out the full version on Steam !  How to Play  Use a combination of mouse and keyboard.  WASD  or  SHIFT+RMB  or  Middle Mouse button  to pan the camera around. Mousewheel  zooms the camera in and out. LMB  tells your Autonaut where to go and what to do. LMB  also picks things up and makes things happen. RMB  drops things. Z  can be used for some things like instruments and signs. Space  blows your whistle so you can get the attention of workerbots. I  brings up your inventory: what's in your hands and your backpack; you can drag and drop objects between slots - and even trade with your workerbots. Holding  Left Shift  and clicking an object will automatically swap between hands /inventory or player/bot. ,  and  .  ( <  and  > ) cycle forwards and backwards through your inventory (to swap the item in your hands). /  or  Q  stows the held item (assuming there's space in your inventory) so you can use your empty hands for other tasks. H  brings up the 'Hot Bar' so you can quickly swap items between your hands and your Inventory. E  brings up the Edit Menu, which is where you choose what to build; note that some things can only be built on flooring. R  rotates building blueprints clockwise, so you can choose which way they face. RMB  deletes a blueprint;  DEL  ( fn-backspace  on Mac) allows you to delete buildings once built (but only while in Edit Mode). Esc  pauses the game and brings up the Pause Menu, from where you can save and load progress. C  toggles 'Free Cam' on/off. Use WASD to move around, Q/E to move up and down and Left Shift to move faster; the Mouse Scroll Wheel zooms in/out; Up/Down Arrow changes movement speed. X  recentres the camera on you.  In this basic world you will find earth, sand, sea, fresh water, clay, rock, trees and cereal - and the resident folk, who are content to sit around in the buff, doing nothing.  And speaking of nothing, that's exactly what you start with. But from these humble beginnings you can build and automate an entire civilisation. Well, you can when the game's further along; for now you can only start a forestry and cereal farming, and provide shelter and food for the folk.  You can also make and teach robots how to do anything you can do, which is aces.  Please Note  Autonauts  is so early in its development that we won't be able to guarantee the compatibility of saved games between versions (but we will do our best to minimise issues).  Also, the Linux version is still untested by us (because we don't have Linux) but feedback so far suggests that it's working well enough, so we'll keep supplying a Linux version with every update :)  Handy Quickstart Guide  So, yeah, this guide may well be creaking around the joints but it's still valid and useful :)  Pick up a Stick, pick up a Stone and build a Crude Axe. Chop down some Trees. Go to the Edit Menu (E) and select 'Simple Flooring' blueprint; place two Simple Flooring blueprints down side by side. Build the Simple Flooring by putting Logs into it. Call up the Edit Menu again and select Crude Bench Saw blueprint; place one on the built flooring. Build the Crude Bench Saw by putting Logs and Planks into it (use your axe to chop Logs to make Planks). Add a 'Worker Assembler' blueprint (which doesn't need to be on the Simple Flooring). Use the Crude Bench Saw to make Planks and Poles for the Worker Assembler. Add a 'Basic Workbench' blueprint (you might need more Simple Flooring) and build it. Click the Basic Workbench and change it to output 'Crude Gear.' Stick a Plank into the Basic Workbench to get a Crude Gear out. Add the Crude Gear to the Worker Assembler along with Planks and Poles to make your first Workerbot. Press Space to whistle and select your Workerbot.  Click 'Trade' and put an Axe into its hand (you'll also need an axe for yourself). Click 'Teach' then chop a tree; click 'Repeat' and then 'Go' to get the Workerbot started. Sit back and enjoy watching your Workerbot chop trees forever (well, until its axe breaks). Now automate EVERYTHING!  If you still get stuck, don't forget to check out our  YouTube playthrough  of the first version from a million years ago, which we really really REALLY ought to update soon.

"A bunch of dudes sit in an office, all of them wearing black suits and white collared shirts. Everyone sits in the same swivel chairs. For a video game, Last Man Kicking sounds really boring. Add shotguns ragdoll physics, and a ball though, and you have a recipe for the only soccer game left to make.		 	 	 		 	       The best way to describe  Last Man Kicking would be to say ""Its Rocket League with swivel chairs and Shotguns"". You can  Play a 2vs2 swivel chair shotgun soccer match with your friends or alone against the Ai.   Gamepad and Keyboard are supported to 100% - You can even play with up to 4 people on one keyboard! No Online Multiplayer!    The History of Last Man Sitting is quite Chaotic. I was working on a very boring GTA clone and out of the sudden, a wild bug appeared which pushed my character always backward while I was trying to shoot. This Bug was actually pretty fun to use and so I ended up creating a whole Game out of it. The first appearance of Last Man Sitting in the wild resulted in an overwhelming  reddit post  with more then 100.000 up votes. I realized pretty fast that there are a few people out there that like this game and so I ended up setting up a  steam page  for Last Man Sitting where you can already add it to your whishlist.  Last Man Kicking IS NOT Last Man Sitting. After the reveal of this game a lot of people asked me if there is a Demo available but I always had to say ""no"" since I don't wanted to give out a half assed broken Demo version just to show something. So I took quite a lot of time to create this Mini Game called ""Last Man Kicking"" now and put a lot of love in every inch of this Game to give you a experience that is worth your money!  So this is a paid Demo? Sounds a bit greedy!    In theory I would love to give out everything I do for free but since I am a single developer its hard to shovel away time to work on this Game but most importantly is the fact that my current Laptop is dying and I urgently need a new one but Iam more or less broke at the moment  During the GlobalGameJam 2018 I was working on a  nice little Penguin Game  but 1 hour before the deadline my Laptop decided to melt my SSD and since I haven't used any version control the whole game was gone. And the same thing happened again 1 week later. So 2 SSDs in 1 week - I think thats a wake up call to buy a new machine.      “you have a recipe for the only battle royale game left to make” 5/7 –  Kotaku  “Office chair battle royale game Last Man Sitting looks dope” 5/7 –  Destructoid  “Basically, it's a recipe for chaos” 5/7 –  PC Gamer           	 		 			 Early Support should be rewarded! 		 		 			Buying this Game means a lot to me! And I thought a lot about what could I give back to the early supporters of this Game. So If you buy Last Man Kicking, you will get a Special Chair and Hat for Last Man Sitting which you see here on the right side. I will sent you a message how to activate this once Last Man Sitting is released. Thank you!		 	 	 		 	          So... do I get Last Man Sitting when I buy this?  No, I wanted to give out this Game for a relative low price. So this is no pre-order!  Does it have online Multiplayer? No, its local only for up to 4 people but also with Bots/Ai Players  When will Last Man Sitting be out? As you can see Last Man Kicking has a high quality regarding Sound, Graphics and general Presentation. I want to keep this high level of Quality so Last Man Sitting will take some time til' its done. I don't want to say when exactly because I wanna deliver the best possible Game and don't let time dictate that - so its done when its done :)  Can I stream this Game on youtube/twitch? Of course! I would love to see some lets plays! don't forget to share them in the comment section :)  I downloaded the LastManKicking.zip - what should I do with it? First you have to unzip it (if you don't know how,  here is a quick tutorial ) and then run the LastManSitting.exe  Do you have a Linux Version? Thats not planed at the moment  The Framerate drops a bit when I score a goal/after the Explosion? The Explosion and the Destructible Glass around is quite performance heavy. there is a HQ/LQ switch in the main menu where you can turn this off by setting it to LQ. That should help if you have performance preoblems.  Cool song! Where can i get it? You will find in the download section a press.zip next to the Game zip. It contains some screenshots and the Song as mp3. The Vocals of the song has been recorded and shouted by  Desert Colossus , check them out :)  Sounds like shit with your Laptop, can I help somehow? If you are Alienware, Dell, Apple, Microsoft, Lenovo, HP whatever... You can sent me a new machine and I will tell everyone how great it is :) other then that, you can support my game creation on my  patreon  or buy one of my other games  if you like :)  So, where can I add Last Man Sitting to my steam Wishlist?

"There is only one bomb. Your objective is to collect healing orbs enough to kill your opponent. Yes, you read it correctly. That's because there is only one life bar for both players, so, when you heal your opponent gets hurt.  Healing orbs have a random chance of appearing from destroyed walls. The more destroyed walls, the more the healing orbs will heal. Destroy the walls with the bomb. When you have the bomb, you can walk through walls, but you get slower, and if your opponent touches you, he will get the bomb - even if you are inside a wall.   If you are carrying the bomb and it explodes outside of a wall, it will hurt you, so be sure to always explode inside a wall. Player 1: WASD Player 2: Arrows PT/BR: Existe apenas uma bomba. Seu objetivo é coletar orbes de vida o suficiente para matar seu oponente. Sim, você leu corretamente. Isso acontece porque existe apenas uma barra de vida, e, se você se cura, seu oponente perde vida. Orbes de vida têm uma chance aleatória de aparecer quando paredes são destruídas. Quanto mais paredes destruídas, mais eles vão curar. Destrua paredes com a bomba. Quando você tem a bomba, você pode andar através de paredes, mas você vai andar mais devagar que seu oponente, e, se ele tocar em você, ele vai roubar sua bomba, mesmo que você esteja dentro de uma parede.

As Trixie gains insight her narration becomes ever more unreliable. Unlike many sanity systems Trixie's insight system is hidden, meaning you never know for sure when you are being affected by it. This system also means additional playthroughs of the game may vary!  Can you really trust anything Trixie sees? Can you afford not to?  Multiple Paths:   Trixie can choose to spend her week with the Friendly, albeit slightly scary shopkeeper Heidi, the excitable baker Gregg or the chill milkwoman Bell. At points the three routes may intertwine, giving different perspectives on the same story. The game also has two main potential endings, with additional minor alternate endings.  A Strange World:   Set in a world of anthropomorphic animals, psychic birds and cosmic gods, Trixie explores the rural England inspired Bluefields County and discovers some of the horrors that secretly lurk in it's scenic countryside.  Art Book:   If you spend $6.99 on Trixie you get an Art book with the game! Exciting stuff! It contains all sorts of concept art,  bios and fun trivia about the game, the characters and the world.   Content Warnings:  Trixie Glimmer Smith contains a few mild descriptions of violence, horror, some exploration of negative trans feelings and some bad language.",Visual Novel,Art Book||Atmospheric||Comedy||Furry||Horror||LGBT||Multiple Endings||renpy||Story Rich||trixie,The Testimony of Trixie Glimmer Smith,digital-poppy.itch.io/trixie

"Chase your opponents and knock down their dominoes - be the Last One Standing! Created for #TOJam 2016: Don't Stop bELEVEN Players using Windows:  (2016-09-03) In the past month, Windows Defender / Microsoft Security Essentials have started flagging some Unity games as malware . This appears to be a false positive,  even affecting some Steam games , and Unity is working with Microsoft to fix the detection to avoid false alarms.  I'm exploring whether there's anything I can do to the game to work around this, but in the meantime, you may need to exempt Last One Standing from this security check in order to play - but I understand if you're hesitant to do so. I'll update this page once a solution has been found. WARNING: DEVELOPMENT BUILD This came together in a weekend, so expect some hiccups. Please let me know below or on Twitter ( @D_M_Gregory ) if you encounter glitches, and I'll try to get them fixed up. New in the latest update (2016-05-30): Mac version now available! (Depending on your security settings, you may get a warning that I'm an unidentified developer,  but this can be overridden ) Dynamic joining & control remapping - when input is detected in any supported slot (3 keyboard options or up to 6 gamepads), it will be automatically assigned to a Lead Domino, or spawned as a new player Idle players will be removed from the next round Improved physics stability & fairness - now much harder to accidentally trip yourself Fixed minor exploit when players remain stationary - players who haven't moved recently become vulnerable to bodychecking until they start laying down trail dominoes Added a jump - no particular strategic importance, it just feels good to hop around sometimes :) No invisible walls - the unwary shall fall to their doom! Improved messaging of draws/ties Fixed issue with music going out of sync when looped too many times Lead Dominoes change facial expressions when their trail is toppling Removed DualShock 4 specific version - tested and it works great with  DS4Windows ; manual control remapping is available if needed Install instructions Unzip and have fun! (Windows users: see note on the game page about a false positive from Windows Defender/Security Essentials. You may need to exempt the game to play until this is fixed) You'll find a controls diagram enclosed. Inputs are assigned dynamically, so whichever key/gamepad you use first becomes player 1, etc. If you accidentally spawn a spare player, just knock them down before your victory lap - idle players will be removed from the next round automatically.

"THE FULL GAME IS ON STEAM:   https://goo.gl/RytY6o   This version is kinda old now, the game has improve alot.   From the depths of the earth, the giant Kaiju horde is marching toward Pokyo City and you are the last line of defense!  Take control of the powerful battle mech Odin and command the forces of humanity against the relentless waves of monsters on Mechs v Kaijus an action-packed tower defense.  Use a combination of strategy and the brute force of the mechs to survive.   Upgrade your defenses, unlock new abilities, research new technologies and hire  mercenaries to help you fight.    The best moments, though, are when you summon your defences from the skies. Time slows as you open the building menu, and each wall and turret slams into the ground instantly via a drop pod: there’s no faffing around with build times. Calling for a wall to arrive in just the right place at just the right time is damn satisfying .  Rock Paper Shotgun by  Matt Cox      Mechs V Kaijus impresses with its cool pixel art visuals and addictive hardcore tower defense gameplay. It’s a tough game that really makes you feel like you’re on the back foot from start to finish.   Alpha Beta Gamer   by  KJ Robertson   A nivel gameplay es un  tower defense  hecho y derecho, pero su principal atractivo pasa por la parte visual, muy inspirada en la animación japonesa de la segunda mitad de los 80. En especial en las creaciones de  Akira Toriyama  y hasta con algunos toques que remiten a  Evangelion .     PressOver por  Juan Lomanto    As a last thing, we want you to know that if you want to support the game, we recently did a Patreon and a indiegogo campaing.

"Hounds of Valor is a character action game starring a sword wielding dog battling monsters in a single player adventure. The game-play utilizes fast paced combat in a fantasy world where dogs are the heroes.  Inspiration comes from the ps2 classics Okami and God of War.  What is in this Demo?  I am calling this a Vertical Slice of the game, it has the near final visuals, base combat , level structure and a boss fight. I have remixed the first mission of the game to create a quick 10-15 minute showcase of my work so far. The current build is missing some sound effects like enemy movement, some attacks and boss music.  Hounds of Valor is still in development and feedback is critical for refinement and evolution, all is welcome. I will continue to update this page as development progresses.  As a dog you have melee attacks like light, heavy and bash, each of these have different functions when held down, chained together or used mid air. Experiment as there are quite a lot of them in the game already!  Psst, try holding heavy attack while at the apex of a double jump!   Read more on my website  http://www.dogatworkgames.com/houndsofvalor/  What is to Come  I have been working on this game for over 3 years in my spare time from a full time job. Now Hounds of Valor is ready to be seen on a larger scale!  I post development on my  Twitter  and  Facebook  accounts so please follow me there too. If you have any questions feel free to ask or message me. I always like to learn and help where I can.   Any shares to others can help tremendously to get the word out. Install instructions The download is a simple Unity executable. Unzip and run HoundsofValor.exe  A gamepad is recommended for play but keyboard and mouse support is present.  System Requirements  This is a full 3d game with pretty heavy graphics so not every machine may be able to run it well. Lowering the graphics settings and disabling grass may help. I will be able to determine minimum/recommended specs after further feedback and testing.  On my laptop I am able to hold 60fps 1080p  save for some frame drops that I am in the process of fixing.  I am playing on a Intel i7-6700HQ cpu and a Geforce GTX 1060 gpu. Please report any odd looking graphics or poor performance. You can do so  here.",Action||Adventure,3D||Action RPG||Animals||Cute||Dogs||Fantasy||Hack and Slash||Singleplayer||Third Person,Hounds of Valor,dogatworkgames.itch.io/houndsofvalor

"The dwarves have abandoned the ringing forges and roaring breweries of Vul Buhldar, and in their absence other, less savory things of the dark have taken up residence. The fortress remains sealed, its locks and bridges having been shut in a final act of defiance from the dwarves, turning what was once a proud citadel into a prison of brass and hewn stone. But mankind has always been easily lured by the promise of the unseen, and you are no different in this curiosity.   A strong sword arm is not all you will need, as you must have the cunning and wisdom to solve complex devices, slip past traps, and decipher the riddles of the dwarves in order to find what they have sealed within their fortress... and to ensure that there it remains.

"SIRENS: THE COLD NORTH  Sirens: The Cold North  is the first short game in a growing series of games that all take place in the same world. See the first installment of the story of the World of Odyssea. Begin to dive into the mythology and setting right here, with the first game in the series, and become familiar with a world where magic, monsters, and politics over thrones are all found.  A new king has come to power in the Lysandian Midlands.   King Silas, a former aide to King Lionel IV now sits upon the throne after the death of Lionel and the disappearance of his son, leaving Lysandia in turmoil. Quickly bringing stability back to the realm, Silas has announced that he is determined to find the son of King Lionel and restore him to the throne that is rightfully his. Meanwhile, the death of King Lionel has left the relations between Lysandia and the other realms of Easterra in question.  In the far north, where the winters are long, and the summers are cold, the Kingdom of Atlantis stands as a monument to the Ancients that founded it millennia ago. While small in number, the Sirens stand protecting the realm that has provided the precious material, Magicite, to the whole of Easterra for generations. Seeking to improve trade relations with his neighbours, King Silas has embarked on a journey to the cold north, visiting the lonely Northern Kingdom.  Tensions are high in the Kingdom of Atlantis, as this important visit and trade deal looms in the distance.   However, this tension is lost on some, as young princess Ruby plays hide and seek with an unwilling seeker while she should be studying magic with the mages...  Play as Ruby, the young princess, and the Queensguard, Saralyn, who is tasked with taking care of the young princess. Atlantis is in full preparations for the arrival of King Silas, but something sinister is bubbling beneath the surface. Investigate the increase of monsters in the area as the royal visit from the Lysandian's draws closer and closer.  Ruby   The young princess of Atlantis, and the hero of the story. Ruby is an aspiring mage, learning to harness the power of magicite so that she can protect her kingdom when it is time for her to reign. Perpetually late, as she always finds herself running off on her own ""adventures,"" Ruby is constantly being chased around by Saralyn, her protector, and member of the Queensguard. Saralyn     A decorated knight in the service of the queen, Saralyn has been given the highest honour afforded one of the Queen's guards: the title of Siren. An elite warrior, she has been assigned to protect Princess Ruby and guide her towards becoming an effective mage and kind ruler. Saralyn outwardly displays impatience with Ruby, but deeply cares for the young princess, and takes guarding her with her life very seriously. The gameplay follows a standard JRPG style, with a sideview battle system. The mechanics of the game itself are not complex, in that there are only two buttons to worry about with the controls: The Z or Enter key for accepting and interaction, and the X or ESC key for cancelling and bringing up the menu. The arrow keys are for movement. I recommend using the Z and X keys with the arrow keys for easy playing. However, while the gameplay is rather standard, there are a few features that provide an interesting twist that make the game challenging. Battle System An animated sideview battle system that should remind players of RPG's from the SNES era of gaming that still provides an element of strategy because of things like: Magicite Consumption While playing as Ruby, you will encounter the standard spells and MP system that you would find in most RPGs, but with a slight twist. In the world of Easterra, magic cannot be cast without the assistance of a resource called magicite. When performing magic, the spells not only cost MP, but also magicite. The magicite cost varies from spell to spell, depending on how powerful it is, and what time of magic cast. The supplies of magicite are limited, and monsters drop it rarely so you must carefully consider when to use your magical abilities. Breakable Weapons and Armor Another feature found within the game is that most armor and weapons will break down over time, leading to them needing to be replaced. The durability level of the weapons and armor can be viewed in the main menu, under items. When preparing to fight a monster, be sure to have an eye on the durability of your armor and weapons, and keep a few extra in stock just in case. Quest System A quest system that keeps track of every main and side quest for you, and rewards you for completing them, even the ones that are more narrative based rather than battle focused. [WIP Features} Trophy Room A trophy room where you can keep track of your achievements that will unlock as you progress in the game. Try to unlock them all, and there might be a bonus scene for you at the end of the game. More to be announced!

"Emma is the lady's maid to the eldest daughter of the Beresford family, Eveline. With no interest in ladylike persuits, the young lady feigns illness at every opportunity for a ball, soiree, or other social activity.   But Emma is no ordinary maid. So when she and her mistress are sent on a journey in the sky, with balls and soirees that are host to many eligible bachelors, the adventure is only just beginning...  Word Count: ~7000  Single playthrough: 15-45 minutes   Setting  The 19th century. Victoria is Queen of Anglia. William Darwin is Prime Minister. Steam-powered technology has spread across the world like wild-fire, enabling global trade and travel of the grandest scale. Ships travel the skyway with ever more interesting cargo - transglobal goods, contraband, princesses - perfect treasure for sky pirates, many of whom operate without a piracy license. Land transport, on the other hand, is dominated by trains, though the locomobile is slowly gaining traction with forward-thinking gentry and nouveau riche.  Love Interests  Although you only meet the love interests briefly in the demo, there are two in the game: a nobleman and a female scientist. I would also like to include a male pirate, if there is time.  Specialisations  At the start of the story, you can choose a specialisation in three different areas: academics, social graces, and forbidden science. These specialisations unlock additional scenes, solutions, and dialogue options throughout the game. In the demo, you get the opportunity to fully explore a challenging puzzle based on a specialisation.  Choices, Choices  The game features a mixture of VN-style choices and RPG-style choices, where some heavily impact the story, while others just add a bit more flavour to your interactions. For those choices that affect the grand scheme of things, there is a slightly different graphic, so you always know whether your decisions are big or small.   Backgrounds  Only 1 background in the demo, I'm afraid. I am using an image drawn during the era that is now in the public domain - with a couple of photoshop tweaks. I know that doesn't exactly sell the game, but I thought I'd be honest about this. :)   Release Date  This project is not my main project, I'm working on it on-and-off while doing other things, such as Stranded Hearts and work I do for a living. As such it will probably take a while. I hope to commit a lot more time to it in the future, once I've released a few more shorter VNs.

"""Starseed Pilgrim is a game about tending a symphonic garden, exploring space, and embracing fate."" 			 			You are a gardener, tending to empty noise and empty space to fill them both with colour. You are a refugee, building your own world away from the spreading darkness. You are an explorer, discovering new places, new rules, and new fascinations. The universe is bigger than you know. ~ I really don't like describing Starseed Pilgrim! But if I don't, I'm pretty much asking you to buy it based on... images, and that's worse. It's a game about discovery and learning, and eventually about mastery of a strange set of tools. It's been said, and echoed, that it's a game you have to experience for yourself.

"'Worlds' is a simulator intended to recreate human history all the way from its origins in alternate world settings.  Current features:  A 2D cell-based terrain generator that creates continent-based worlds with semi-realistic temperature, rainfall patterns, and drainage basins. Biomes, like deserts, forests, and rivers, are assigned to each cell based on its specific climate.  An alternate 3D globe visualization of the map with a simulated, cosmetic day/night cycle. A map editor that allows you to modify the terrain in multiple ways: Offset the global seal levels, temperatures and global rainfall. Or use a brush to tweaks individual attributes on each cell. Humanity starts from a single place on the map, either chosen by you or random, and spreads all over the world, adapting along the way to the diverse environments. Populations in different places grow and evolve, diverging socially and technologically over time under the influence of environmental factors and interactions with other cultures. Population groups can join and form basic political and territorial entities (polities). Each which might in turn develop its own language and culture. Multiple map modes and overlays that will allow you to observe how human groups differ from each other on multiple aspects, from population densities to cultural attributes and technological advancements. You can take over polity factions and have some level of influence on events that happen to them. Mod Support: You can create and add mods to customize or add biomes, add layers, add region elements, and even add or modify discoveries to be made by the humans of your worlds.  Planned features (see also the  roadmap ):  World Generation: Improve the world generation process to add more geological features and adhere to the theory of plate tectonics. Add oceanic current. These will have an effect on climates, fishing and maritime routes. Add geological/planetary events: volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, climate change, etc. Add more customizable world generation parameters, templates and modding. Add support for bigger/smaller worlds.  History Simulation: Add more production activities like herding, crafting, trading, etc. Add cultural values to societies which will influence how different human groups behave, evolve and interact with each other. Add more abstract cultural identification/separation mechanics (art, social customs, sports). Add cults/religions which might expand and influence societies. Add population centers (villages, towns, cities) to which populations will migrate and where more complex production systems (industries) can evolve. Add a more robust agricultural system where different crops can be planted and harvested, and different animals can be domesticated and exploited. Add to polities more complex politics, different forms of government and different social structures (ie. clan systems, caste/class based societies, egalitarian societies). Add diplomatic interactions between polities: conflicts, treaties, alliances, etc. Add trading routes between cities and polities. Add more modding support User Interface: Add more and improved visualization overlays and views. Add data graphs and a history log viewer. Add a 3D globe view. Music/SFX: Add basic UI sounds. Add a procedural music generator that creates music tailored to individual cultures. User/Player Interactions: Improve a player's ability to take control/influence individual polities. Add the ability to 'time-travel' to arbitrary periods in a world's past without the necessity to load a save. Add an in-engine time-lapse viewer/player.

For those who haven't played the original, yes, there is actually a space whale in it.  Arrow keys to move! No other controls, whatever the on-screen indicators might make you think.  The game is made with  Bitsy  by Adam Le Doux, plus a lot of custom code this time. Special thanks go as ever to  Sean S.

For anyone curious, the speedrun timer starts as you get out of the bed, and stops as soon as the Space Whale's dialogue box appears.

"Signs of the Sojourner is a narrative deck-building game about connecting and communicating with others. It breaks away from typical card-battlers by instead challenging you to understand different perspectives and navigate social situations.  Your deck is your character, shaped by your experiences and relationships. Different decks will lead to different narrative paths as your cards impact your ability to communicate with various characters. Rather than building the most ""powerful"" deck, you will have to make decisions about who you want to be in this world and how you relate to others.  Set in a near-future earth-like world, you take over your mother's store after her death, traveling to diverse locations in order to acquire goods for the shop. This is a world where communities are more insulated, where travel is difficult, and where climate change has made life hard, but you'll still encounter optimistic stories, compassionate characters, and delightful surprises.

"WolfQuest 3: Anniversary Edition (early access)  We're remaking the game from the ground up!  Bigger and better gameplay, huge new maps, more animals...and it's a  free update  if you own WolfQuest 2.7!   The first episode, Amethyst Mountain, is available  as Early Access for PC/Mac now! While in Early Access, we will be updating the game frequently with more features, multiplayer, and ultimately the Slough Creek episode with pups.  The mobile version will come after the game is completed on PC/Mac platforms  We’ll then resume development of the next episode, Tower Fall.   Learn more in the  game FAQS  and  devblog !  WolfQuest 2.7   With your purchase of WolfQuest, you get both WolfQuest 2.7 Classic and WolfQuest 3: Anniversary Edition (early access)!   IMPORTANT:  The Free Trial is for WQ 2.7, not for the new Anniversary Edition -- which has higher hardware requirements than WQ 2.7 had, so please check those specs before purchasing. (We do not currently have a free trial for WQ: Anniversary Edition.) WQ: Anniversary Edition has significantly higher hardware requirements than the old game. Be sure to check them below before purchasing!  Live the life of a wild wolf  	 You are a two-year old gray wolf  born in the Northern Range of Yellowstone National Park. You learned the ways of the wolf in your birth pack. Now it's time for you to learn how to live on your own, finding food, meeting other wolves, and searching for a mate. Ultimately, your goal is to find a home and build your own family.  Embark on a quest for survival  	 Your quest begins  on the slopes of Amethyst Mountain and eventually takes you across the Lamar Valley to Slough Creek. There, you and your mate will establish a territory and raise a litter of pups: training them, feeding them, defending them against predators, and finally taking them on a cross-country journey to a summer home. Ultimately, your success will depend on your ability to ensure the survival of your pack.   Experience Yellowstone National Park  Explore WolfQuest's realistic recreation of the Northern Range of Yellowstone National Park — ""the Serengeti of North America"" — where herds of elk and other ungulates roam the sagebrush steppe grasslands, alpine forests, and magnificent high ridges.  But watch out for packs of stranger wolves, who patrol their territories and don't look kindly on intruders. The wilderness brims with other dangers as well — grizzly bears, cougars, and coyotes — who all vie with you for territory and food.  Realistic Ecology and Gameplay (Anniversary Edition)  WolfQuest: Anniversary Edition raises the bar for realistic and accurate eco-simulation gameplay: Herds of elk roam the land in realistic herds, along with moose, mule deer, and other prey.  Other wolf packs maintain and defend their territory against intruders -- like you. Grizzlies, cougars, coyotes, and other predators challenge you over your kills -- and protect theirs. Wolves communicate with each other using natural actions and vocalizations. Dynamic (family-friendly) courtship interactions allow you to choose a suitable mate. Vast wilderness maps (nearly 50 square kilometers) depict Yellowstone's Northern Range.  Dynamic day/night, weather, and seasons immerse you in the wilderness.  Our science advisors include some of the top wolf biologists in the world today, who help us keep WolfQuest accurate to real wolf biology and behavior.  Play the game alone or with friends   In single-player games, learn how to hunt elk, communicate with other wolves, find a mate in  Amethyst Mountain .   (Amethyst Mountain is currently available in WolfQuest 3: Anniversary Edition early access  and  WolfQuest 2.7)  In  Slough Creek , establish a den and territory, raise pups, and embark on a perilous journey to a summering site.	 (Slough Creek is currently only available in WolfQuest 2.7) 	 In  multiplayer games  ( currently only available in WolfQuest 2.7)  , explore the wilderness, hunt elk, and raise pups with your friends! There are two types of multiplayer games:  	 Private games:  Invite-only, featuring voice, text, and phrase chat. 	 Public games:  Anyone can join, phrase chat -- and now plus text chat for players age 13 and up!   Bonus Option: Soundtrack and Music Extras  	For $5 more, get the  WolfQuest Soundtrack and M usic Extras , which include the complete game soundtrack, including 22 new tracks from Anniversary Edition, and a 25-minute video featuring game composer Tim Buzza talking about how he created the signature sound of WolfQuest and many memorable tracks in the game.

"“Gazing at the shiny crescent looming overhead, I get an impossible sense of longing; but also… sadness, and fear.   Who am I?”  Set in a world of fable and wonders, with inspiration ranging from Final Fantasy to Studio Ghibli, Antistar tells of a determined, pig-tailed heroine, on a journey to retrieve her lost memories.   Nameless heroine explains the game  ""My name is... what was my name again? Okay, let's start over. I will have you know that I am not a magical girl. Let that sink in. Also, do not think of me as a thing you're going to play with. I may be a game character (but really I'm not) however it will be productive if you think of me as being thirteen years old (apparently) with arms, legs and a loud mouth. I am brave but die-able (1 hp), please take care of me:  Will jump, walk and run. Until I find a weapon these abilities will be tremendously helpful. Talking to magical creatures and balding guys is the way I know to gather useful advice. Able to carry very useful things(*) - be it a little food, a huge key or a handy flute(**)  I have my own feelings, and enjoy reminiscing (when you're not fiddling with your controller)  Let's adventure together (macOS, Linux, Windows - high specs don't care)"" (*) My pajamas do not have magical bottomless pockets for your 50 items inventory. (**) I play the flute, not the ocarina.  A word from the author  This is a follow up to  Antistar 3D: Rising  (released only on iPhone/iPad; 2010). iFanzine praised the original game as  a glimpse of something wonderful .  The game was re-made from the ground up, and extended (2 additional chapters).  In creating this I asked - being a teenage person lost in a fantasy universe, what would it be  like ? It would be awesome, right? And very dangerous.  You would spare a thought for your skin, before confronting giant metal birds head on.  You'd really be wanting to make friends along the way.  So, I created this game; being mindful of three things.  Give you a fair challenge . Strictly, good reflexes and wits suffice to complete the game, possibly in a single sitting (playing  randomly  however is a recipe for frustration and 100 deaths) Avoid complex controls, a onscreen UI and other distractions. Avoid  artificial constraints . I grew up finding it odd that games which let us fly and target 10 foes with meteor attacks, then refuse to let me climb over a short fence.  While I am still working to make this game ""bigger and better"", it is complete, and I hope you will enjoy it.  To learn more about current and future dev, head over to my  Patreon  page, where you can also subscribe to support this work.  A sequel is intended (will be released separately) - My  wish  is to complete the Antistar Saga by 2020 - 4 'books', 7 chapters per issue.",Adventure,3D||3D Platformer||Action-Adventure||Anime||antistar||fable||Fantasy||heroine||Sci-fi,Antistar: Rising,eelstork.itch.io/re-antistar

It does suffer a little bit from the PICO-8's very limited set of buttons.  Sorry!  (If you're not familiar, the PICO-8 is an imaginary 8-bit-ish console, and it only exposes pretend X and O buttons and a d-pad — games can't read directly from the keyboard.  Also, X and O are actually the X and Z keys, but they can also be other keys, so I can't just say X and Z.)  	Despite my best efforts, it's possible to get stuck in one or two places.  Press Enter to bring up the menu, where you can reset the room.  Also, up and down cycle through the inventory — there's a little UI hint that tells you this, but it doesn't always show up  	A couple puzzles are a bit clever, but not too difficult (with perhaps one exception), so the game is only five or ten minutes long.

The world in MoonQuest is fully destructible, so you'll be chopping through thick vines to gain entrance to lairs and demolishing walls to infiltrate castles and ruins. Some challenges in the world may require specialised tools to overcome, but the challenges are always surmountable. Some examples of regions you may encounter are:  A forest buried in snow, with frozen ponds and wandering bandits; A grand castle atop a mountain, guarded by a silver legion; A labyrinthine ruin preceding a desolate tomb; A rope bridge leading to a deserted beach; A sewer system hiding an ancient rusted machine; A winding system of sugar caves, populated by bats; A cathedral plagued by demons, hidden below an altar; and, A bustling village of craftspeople.  Moons  The world in MoonQuest is surrounded by a number of strange moons. Each new game uses a randomly generated set of moons, each with subtle influences on the landscape below it. Some of the moons you may encounter are:  Giant Moon : a featureless orb which embiggens many things; Treasure Moon : a shining beacon which symbolises great wealth; Water Moon : a beautiful blue sphere which brings relentless rain and flood; and, Frog Moon : a green rock that creates frogs, lots of frogs.  Playable characters  There are many playable characters in MoonQuest, many with unique abilities or items. Some characters affect the world that is generated and some characters pursue different quests. Some of the characters available include:  Moonman : a cheerful green alien whose smile illuminates the world; Amphibian : a creature from the sea who breathes underwater; Argonax : a powerful wizard who wields a magic wand; Spartan : a warrior equipped with golden armour who must vanquish the undead; Gromlet : a famous actor with something to prove; Elemental : a being who can attune to ore with his powerful antennae; Carl : a stranded astronaut who must avoid the giants and return home; Meteor : an entity of hellfire which burns everything he loves; Hunter : an assassin who must fulfill a deadly contract; and, Many others!  Items  There are hundreds of items to discover and craft, including weapons, tools, and armour. These items may be hidden deep within a mountain, in the cellar of a merchant, or locked away in a dungeon. Finding these items will help you not die. In the town you'll find merchants and crafting tools, and by locating the right currency or resources you can buy, forge, cook, or weave many useful items. Some of the items in MoonQuest are:  Weapons, such as the  Ornate Silver Sword ,  Polymorph Wand , and  Dragon Staff ; Tools, such as the  Golden Shovel ,  Royal Longbroom, and  Giant Feather ; Helmets, such as the  Bell Helmet ,  Royal Kabuto , and  Plumed Bascinet ; Masks, such as the  Skull Mask ,  Bird Mask , and  Salamander Mask ; Armour, such as the  Moon Robe ,  Gloom's Curse , and  Sky Raiment ; Shields, such as the  Buckler ,  Glorious Bench , and  Guard of the Serpent ; Useful items, such as the  Spyglass ,  Compass , and  Map ; Precious resources, such as  Iron Ingots ,  Coins , and  Crystals ; and, Accessories, such as the  Smorkin' Pipe ,  Walking Stick , and  Round Glasses .  F.A.Q.  Can I use a controller?  Yes, the game supports a wide-range of controllers. However, we recommend playing MoonQuest with a mouse and keyboard.  What are the minimum requirements?

"Think you've seen all the internet has to offer? Probably not, so why not come play this now!!!!! TAANG is a somewhat....unusual game...in that, it doesn't have one specific type of gameplay, it is a platformer, FPS, racing game and multiplayer game you can play with others, all in one. Why go anywhere else?    As this game is currently a WIP, it is not (at this time) paid. However, in the future it will be, so anyone that downloads the game (for free) now, will get the full game for free.    All money earned from this game will go towards an expedition in 2019, in which I will be traversing Ecuador, and helping to build wells and schools and anything else the local communities need, in that area of the world. Many of the people there are far less fortunate than anyone that goes on this site (financially) and therefore, it would be great if you could buy this game when it comes out properly.   Please, please leave a review, telling me how I can improve, once I get it, I will begin working on the problem immediately.     Also find TAANG at any of the following locations:  Get it on Gamejolt ,  Play online at Kongregate   - certain browsers only  Or look at our page on Humble.com , Install instructions To download, click the download button, and then it will begin. Once downloaded, open up the zip file, and then the .exe executable file.

"Embark is a deep colony sim in a huge living world. Inspired by the deep simulation of Dwarf Fortress, the open world survival of Minecraft, and the social interactions of The Sims. Embark follows a group of explorers who find themselves on a strange, seemingly uninhabited planet.  A fully 3D destructible world allows you to build anything from small trading outposts to huge fortresses. An intuitive interface makes managing your colony easy. Order your people to build complex structures and sit back and watch as they complete them.  A source of fresh water is critical to your colony’s survival. Water volume is simulated (and limited!). It flows like you would expect it to. Build pumps and aqueducts to move water.  Give them some free time and characters will write books and potentially teach others their skills. Design luxurious rooms to keep them happy Characters in Embark are simulated in detail: They get hungry, thirsty, lonely, or tired. They each have their own interpersonal relationships, social status, and personalities. With the game’s focus on smaller groups each member of your colony is unique and important, and you can really get to know your people.  Explore a huge procedurally generated 3D world and meet its inhabitants. The map is over 2km by 2km, over it are scattered flora, fauna, and various factions and encounters. Juggle between building your base and exploring the map for more resources. You will never feel cramped by the looming edge of the map.  Modding will be fully supported by Embark.

"Witchball  is a post-reality racing game played by children in the year 2601.  Massive environmental change has made much of the world inaccessible, and long-distance travel impossible. Communities are isolated, but communication has advanced to the point where short distances between people barely exist at all.  In Witchball, two players compete in a high speed foot-race while simultaneously playing a 2D pong-like ball game on the surface of the screen. Points are gained in both aspects and tallied per lap, so it’s important -- and tricky -- to manage the space better than the opponent.  _________________________________________  ** LOCAL MULTI-PLAYER ONLY **  (Two XBOX controllers recommended,  at least one is required for controller share)  *^*^*  >> Four locations and 3 modes, for a total of 9 Tracks  <<  >> 8 different mysterious special abilities <<  Have fun!  *^*^*  Originally used for fishing, glass buoys became associated with witches during witch-hunts in the late 1600s. Traditionally, a ‘witch ball’ is a glass orb hung in a home to ward away bad or evil spirits. The act of play, and games by extension, can function in a similar way -- kind of like a respite from the darkness. Games won’t solve any problems, and neither will a ward, but safeguards and rest are necessary parts of life and games can provide that. A game as a ward, not an escape.  _________________________________________  made with GameMaker Studio 1.4  <  http://twentycapitalletters.com/Witchball  >  AMAZE Festival,  Nominee - Human Human Machine Award  IGF 2018,  Honorable Mention  - Nuovo Award  Ludicious  2018,  WINNER  -  Innovation in Game Award  IndieCade 2017,  Official Selection  IGF 2017 ,  Honorable Mention  - Nuovo Award",Sports||Racing,2D||artgame||Atmospheric||Dark||GameMaker||Local multiplayer||Multiplayer||Surreal||witch,Witchball,eselsi.itch.io/witchball

"Battle for justice in an anime-themed world as Nina Aquila, defence attorney and bona fide Legal Eagle!  Nina Aquila: Legal Eagle  is an anime-themed graphic adventure game, in which you play the role of a defence attorney. Fledge City is in crisis, and it's up to Nina Aquila and her friends to make sure justice prevails!  A fully-SFW graphic adventure Take the role of a new defence attorney Get to know a cast of quirky characters Defend your client in court!  With a tone that mixes crime with a light-hearted feel, a cast of quirky characters and a compelling story,  NALE  is intended as a homage to the Phoenix Wright franchise, but should appeal to all fans of anime & graphic adventures.  This first case is ~1 hour in duration.  Chapter 2 can be found  HERE !   Chapter 1: First Flight  In each chapter, Nina takes on the case of a client who has been charged with a major crime, who she believes to be innocent. To prove this, she and her friends journey to different areas around Fledge City, gathering evidence, before going to court to fight for her client's cause.  Freshly qualified as a defence attorney, Nina's first few cases go well... But when her mentor is imprisoned for a crime she didn't commit, her career becomes a casualty of a secret war... A war that, unknown to Nina, is connected to her own past.  A great game is being played for the heart of the city by the ruthless and powerful, but right now, Nina doesn't even know who is playing, much less the rules. She will need to trust her friends and forge new alliances if she is to fight for justice and uncover the truth.   Content/Trigger Warnings NALE Chapter 1 should not present any major trigger or content issues for most adults. However, the story touches upon a disaster involving a fire at a campground, and may distress those who have particular aversion to themes of fire-related injury. Current state of the project  NALE is created on a chapter-by-chapter basis.  Funds raised will initially go towards the unique assets required to create the future cases, with a long-term goal of replacing all the visual aspects of the game with unique character and environment assets.  Future Plans  The game will appear on Itch.io in chapters, where, generally, each chapter represents one case for Nina to solve, as part of the overall story. This first case is streamlined to act as an introduction, but following cases include...  Exploration of crime scenes Conversations with witnesses and NPCs An explorable version of Fledge City Minigames and puzzles  Future cases will be based around unique themes that serve as pastiche or parody of popular anime genres and geeky activities; for example, a murder at an underground club for players of a collectible card game, or a theft that will see Nina and her friends get involved in illegal mountain road tōge racing!

"About Starship Command 2  	 Starship Command 2  is a much-expanded (and currently in alpha) sequel to  Starship Command,  a persistent-world, massively single-player, real-time tactical starship simulator wrapped in an AI-driven 4X game. Starting with a lowly shuttle, you will trade and battle your way to victory, amassing a gigantic fleet customized to your liking!  What Is Meant by  Massively Single-Player?  	 Massively Single-Player  means when you start  Starship Command 2  the first time, it will generate a galaxy with thousands of sectors, each with their own planets and economies. Then populate the galaxy with AI-controlled empires that will attempt to conquer every sector. The galaxy persists through every captain you play as. And you can swap between multiple captains and play both sides of a conflict.  	The empires will create wars and alliances with other empires, and even break out in civil wars.  But What Do I Do?  	Take command of a starship! (or a fleet of starships). Build a fortune by trading commodities, completing missions, collecting taxes from sectors and battle the other empires for glory!  Features:  	 Hundreds of empires (hand-crafted and computer generated) to play. 	 Thousands of sectors to colonize, trade with or attack. 	 Automated captain's log generation will note actions taken by you and later save the entire log to a file. 	 Persistent galaxy that stays through all captains you play as.    What is Currently Working:  	 Galaxy generation - All galaxies are based on moddable JSON files. 	 Moddability - In fact, all files are either JSON or PNG, making the game mod-friendly! 	 Empire AI - All empires will act & react to other empires, creating a dynamic galaxy that can span thousands of years. 	 Economy - Trading commodities between sectors and colonizing sectors. 	 Captain's Log - Working, but still needs polishing as more features are added to  Starship Command 2. Randomly-created ship hulls and components Massive real-time, tactical, space battles - Possibly hundreds of ships battling, while balancing power usage, shield sections, weapon and shield frequencies, etc. Ship-boarding and capture - Beam aboard enemy ships and capture or sabotage while the battle rages on around you. Job boards - Standard jobs, such as take me here, bring this here. Space Monsters - A large apocalyptic cigar? A disembodied translucent-colored hand? A giant space amoeba? Space squids? Who knows!   What is Planned:  	 More Job boards and scenarios - Scenarios such as moral dilemmas, logic problems, nemesis-battles, space-monsters, empire super-weapons, etc. 	 Planet exploration - Beam down to a planet and explore the terrain, people and animals.",Simulation,Exploration||Futuristic||Sci-fi||Space||Space Sim||Tactical,Starship Command 2,evglabs.itch.io/starshipcommand2

"Version 12 is here, with substantial bug fixes and better evolution  Evol Pedal is a walking evolution simulator where lifeforms reproduce based on their ability to travel forward. They evolve their own methods of walking, crawling, jumping, or climbing to adapt to the environment.  	Each movement and characteristic is programmed into their virtual genes, all of which can change over time through random mutations. Segments are connected with joints (the bold, colored lines between them), of which either stay stiff or can revolve and pivot. Each muscle has its own timers, which change over time, giving rise to intricate movement patterns.  	Different variations of the parent lifeform will be tried until one of them passes the flag. If the mutated offspring doesn't do better than its parent, it's discarded. Then, another mutation based off the parent is tried. Once an offspring passes the flag, it becomes the new parent and so on.  With a multitude of settings, you can tweak the simulation to your liking. Set the amount of mutations, sizes, the amount of joints, the round time, gravity, and more. You can adjust things like falling, forcing evolutions that walk with their heads upright. Uncapped framerates (as of Version 12) use more processing power to run through the rounds faster.   Timescale  This simulation is unpredictable. Random mutations can get lucky, and your proactive setting adjustment may decrease the time it takes something cool to evolve. Remember, what looks cool to us means nothing to evolution. The lifeform's only objective is to go forward. That said, it can take hundreds of rounds before a generation emerges that is both able to traverse the screen and looks interesting while doing it.  Tips for Success  Spawn a new lifeform until you see something you like. Observe. Does it flail violently? Lower the power. Is it nearly motionless? Increase the power (within reason, difficulty is good) or gravity accordingly. Decide if barriers would encourage your lifeform to evolve how  you  want it to. For example, small blocks for it climb over forces it to lift its legs up rather than sliding. Play around with round times. You can start with a short round time to encourage efficient initial movements. Then, after it has matured, increase the round time to work on efficiency in traveling with the movements it's built up. If you notice a particular feature or mutation that you want to keep, clear the flag. That will make that lifeform win the round automatically. If you like the amount of joints your lifeform has, set the min and max to exactly that number. This way, it won't lose or gain any and will instead work with what it has. Take a screeshot/screencast of your accomplishment and post it in the comments below if you create something cool  Build  Use the build tool to create blockades, barriers, and stairs for your lifeform to get around. Even simple small blocks will force the lifeform to evolve an inventive mechanism for maneuvering past them.  Controls  Scrollwheel or - +: Zoom In/Out  Esacpe/P: Pause Game  Arrow/Enter Keys: Select and change items on the menu  WASD: Pan the camera  Control + 0: Reset the camera  Other shortcuts are shown in the bottom left when highlighting menu options.

"+40.000 visits & +22.000 downloads! Thanks all of you, guys! :D Featured on GameJolt marketplace with +40.000 downloads!   This project is made as practical exercise for the ""Master in Video Game Development with Unity3D & 3DS Max Official Autodesk (MPV)"" of CICE Madrid ( http://cice.es/curso/master-en-desarrollo-de-videojuegos-con-unity-y-3dsmax/ ).  	A ""primitive shooter"" developed in one month with technical restrictions based on the topics seen in class until the project start date. The game is not optimized (its performance is not stable).  	Support 	 XBox360 Controller  in all PC platforms (implementing the input map for Linux and OSX following the information found on this  wiki ).  	The game is initially designed to be played in 5~10 minutes (It can take 20~30 minutes to complete).  	Developed and full tested under:  	 Intel Core i5-2500 @ 3.30GHz 	 8GB RAM 	 AMD Radeon HD 6800 Series (with Crimson drivers) 	 Windows 10 Pro x64   Links  	 Game web site:  http://portfolio.visualstudioex3.com/2017/02/20/the-esc4pe-a-primitive-shooter/ 	 Post on my blog, Visual Studio EX3, with more details (ES):  http://visualstudioex3.com/blog/gamedev/the-esc4pe-un-primitive-shooter-hecho-en-unity3d/ 	 Twitter (ES):  @ex3_tlsa 	 Facebook (ES):  http://www.facebook.com/visualstudioex3    After start a new game, first learn the input controls  	You can find the input controls layout, for 	 Keyboard & Mouse  and  XBox360 Game Controller,  in the main menu by clicking on  Controls  button.  	   	    Change log  UPDATED 14 mar 2017: Fixed mouse issue  Some user reporting a problem with the mouse control. The problem seems to be a great acceleration or zero response, which makes the game unplayable. This was a bug in my code, and as promised, I publish an new update with the bug fixed. I also take this opportunity to include some improvements and changes:  Fixed problem with mouse input (thanks for you feedback, guys!). Reprogrammed the mouse input. Now, you can configure both horizontal and vertical sensitivity in a major range of values. Added trigger event when the first sniper soldier not spawn their weapon when he died. In this case, if the player advances in the scenary, automatically get the rifle weapon. Fixed some colliders in some columns on tower base in outdoor zone (remove transparent zones). Added some fences in outdoor zone for forcing the player to pass near of the tower ladder. Minor changes on first area (a little surprise when you pick up the second handgun).  Ensure that you downloaded the last update. You must see in the bottom of the main menu the following text:  UPDATE #2 (14 MAR 2017)  UPDATED 02 MAR 2017: Fixed download issue  	In the past days, several users have experienced  some kind of problem with the download links. Initially, the download links pointed to the files in my portfolio web site (an external server). Now, I uploaded on itch.io the download files. This will be fixed the download issue on some users.  Take this opportunity, and thanks for the feedback received from the video reviews, I fixed some little bugs and implement some improvements:  Fixed final message text. Fixed a couple of sound effects that not working. Now, the grenades explodes inmediately on enemy contact (This will make grenades more useful!) Increased the Final Boss enemy life (remember the grenades!) The items in Final Boss arena (placed on columns) now are respawnables: respawn mid armor, mid medpacks, mid shotgun ammo and small grenades pack after 10 seconds of picking up the last item. This prevents the player from running out of ammo or life & armor in the Final Boss battle.  Have fun! :)   P.D.: This game will not receive new updates, bug fixes or new version with more levels.

"Smith and Winston is a Metroidvania style exploration twin stick shooter.  Taking on the role of Smith or Winston, two hapless mercenaries, you explore a newly discovered shattered ring world and uncover the secrets of the natives and the impending doom of the star system. Only you can save the system from the evil that awaits... or not.    Hand built  &dash;     The world needs more hand crafted games. We love procedurally generated games but there is nothing like a level designed by    a human for a human.  Exploration  &dash;     There are many strange places to explore in Smith and Winston along with secrets and puzzles to discover and items to collect. You'll need a sharp eye to spot some of them and a bit of dexterity to reach others. But there's plenty to find.  Challenging twin stick combat   &dash;     There's no health bars and with limited lives dodging is as important as shooting. Don't worry we've given you the tools to survive. From guns and power ups, grenades and missile launchers, to being able to sculpt the terrain to your advantage. How you defeat enemies is up to you.   Free Flowing Movement  &dash;     Smith and Winston come with some cool toys, a jump pack boost for going up and a dash for going fast. Great for dodging bullets but even better for reaching new areas. Combine these for bigger and further jumps. Dash, boost, dash can get you a long way but a clever use of the terrain and our in game physics can get you higher and further.  Voxels  &dash;     We love 'em. In a voxel world the player can destroy nearly everything and you have the equipment to do just that. From mining lasers to dig out secrets to grenades that blast holes in everything. Use these tactically or just to make a hole and laugh as you adversary falls helplessly to their doom.  Camera  &dash;     Smith and Winston is a full 3D game and to take advantage of that we added in a few things. A rotatable 360° camera lets you see what you want and 3 angles of tilt, fancy a more cinematic perspective, just drop the camera angle.  Collectibles  &dash;     Collect and swap your heads there a lot to find and finding them all won’t be easy and with our steam release we'll be adding steam achievements and cards too.  At the Dawn of time there existed powerful beings known as the 'First Ones'.       These Gods created huge ring worlds, each orbiting its own captive star.  They competed to perfect these worlds and their people's revelled in the beauty of their lands and revered the genius of the creators.   But Pride and Arrogance would see them fall. The Ancient texts tell of their destruction:  Armies of machines fought and clawed and  were eviscerated in the blink of an eye.  The Gods clashed unleashing mighty weapons of doom.  Tearing, ripping asunder the fabric of the galaxy.  Until weakened and exhausted, they fell into slumber.  And they were forgotten.      Aeons passed until a scientific expedition discovered a ring world far out in the uncharted territories.  The expedition sent news of an artefact of great destructive power buried deep within.       And this was the last that was heard of them. And every other expedition that was sent to find them. Until there was no one stupid enough to follow.      Or so it was thought. Blessed only with the ignorance of their own foolishness, our heroes Smith and Winston find themselves hurtling towards the Ring…   Who are we?  Hi, if you're wondering who we are this is the section for you!       We're a small team, basically there's Dazza and Charlie. We handle all the art and code ourselves.      We both love games though people have a sneaking suspicion that Dazza thinks games hit their peak with DOOM II, their decline only marginally arrested by any Nintendo release, especially Pikmin. Charlie on the other hand has a huge Steam back catalogue of unplayed games and still buys into every sale knowing full well he doesn’t have to time to finish them, though in his defence he doesn't have the skill to finish them either.      Anyway Smith and Winston started some 5 years ago when we decided we wanted to do a classic style arcade twin stick shooter for our second game. Our first port of call, like so many developers was Unity where we developed a pretty run of the mill proof of concept. Disheartened and unhappy with that we hit on the bright idea of voxels, Unity doesn’t handle voxels well so building our own engine and editor came next, ho-hum Rome wasn't built in a day and we reckon the hard work was worth it.   Why Itch.io?      We are planning on releasing on more stores in the near future but right now we feel First Access on itch.io offers the best options for us and hopefully for you too. With automated update deployment, keys and community features we really like what itch.io offers, it's big thumbs up from us  Can I stream Smith and Winston?      Yes! that would be great, we do ask that you let your viewers know that it is a First Access build that you are playing. Also let us know so we can tweet about it.  Co-op?       At the moment the build is only single player but we plan to release 2 player local co-op soon.  Update #8 added two player split screen coop although currently save games aren't working for coop.  DRM?  The short answer is NO, here is no DRM.  The longer answer is:DRM (or Digital Rights Management) is a system where game developers and publishers make games more annoying and difficult to install, play and modify in the hope that the game wont be pirated. We are honestly too small of a team to worry  about things like this. We'd love for you to pay for the game but if you're going to pirate it... well we can't stop you. Maybe donate some money to a worthy charity or put it towards getting a good education.   This game took us FIVE YEARS TO MAKE! (ಥ﹏ಥ)  Controllers?  The game was designed to be played with a twin stick controller. Controllers supported out of the box are:       XBox 360 (wired/wireless)      XBox One      Playstation DS4   But to be honest, if you've got a controller that works with other games it will likely work with Smith and Winston just as long as it's got twin sticks.  If something isn't working then just let us know and we'll see what we can do.  Keyboard and mouse still work as well but you'll need a separate mouse, a trackpad on a laptop will totally suck.  EULA?  A EULA or End User License Agreement is how we can tell you what you can and can't do with Smith and Winston after you've bought it. You can read the  EULA HERE  but it does NOT:       stop you modifying the game for personal use.      stop you streaming or recording the game.      stop you reviewing the game or commenting about it on line or in print.      stop you meme-ing the game.   macOS App Signing?  This App is NOT signed so Catalina users may have to jump through hoops to get it to run.   We're just two guys trying to make a fun game. We just want you to have fun. All we really ask is that you respect that.",Action||Adventure||Shooter,3D Platformer||Arcade||Local Co-Op||Metroidvania||Space||Twin Stick Shooter||Voxel,Smith and Winston,executionunit.itch.io/smith-and-winston
"Overnight is a short, 5-10 minute story based game where you collect items for your three puppies while simultaneously confronting your gradual loss of memory. As you explore the woods, you think of memories from previous seasons and the nearing threat of winter. Spoiler: it's pretty sad.   There is one side quest during the events of Overnight. While not necessary to complete the game, it will slightly alter the ending.   This game has been a large labor of love, and I really tried to test my pixel art and music making abilities with it. The OST, strategy guide, and story explanation are all available for download on this same page. I highly suggest reading the story explanation after finishing the game, unless you want to make your own theories first :)  This game would not have been remotely possible without the help and/or use of  Bitsy  by Adam le Doux, the  Bitsy Discord Server ,  Borksy Game Hacker  by Ayolland, and a variety of Bitsy hacks including...  bitsymuse  by David Mowatt directional avatar  by Sean S.

"Story:  Riley is a completely unremarkable woman, if you were to ask her. A plane ride towards a job that could change her destiny ends in disaster when there's a critical engine failure during flight. It would be the end for Riley too, were it not for a  remarkable  woman who claims to be from the year 2165.  Yup, it's a time travel story folks.  Characters :   The protagonist. Riley was a sous chef for years, mistreated and underappreciated in the kitchen.  The very day she was going to interview for a position as head chef at a fancy restaurant, she was in a plane crash and died. Or she would have been if she wasn't brought to the future. But in this world, cooking is a dying art, and she's the only one who can revive it. She decides to attempt being a professional chef again in an attempt to prove she can make a significant contribution to society. If she can't, however, the consequences could be far more severe than just having to go back to school.     A historian from the year 2165. Her job is to travel back in time and investigate events that happened in the past without disrupting the future. She's a fun-loving woman who knows what she wants, and isn't afraid to go after it. Finding Riley has made no significant contributions to society, she decides to bring her into the future to allow her a second chance after hitting it off on the plane. The head historian and a very strict, serious woman. She doesn't appreciate Max's nonsense and if the woman wasn't so good at her job Cecilia would have fired her long ago. She respects confidence and intelligence. Her outwardly frigid demeanor might make it hard for people to get a read on her, but Cecilia isn't afraid to speak her mind and make her thoughts known.

What would you do if you were trapped someplace all alone? 	 Put A Sock In It!  dares ask the question: How far would you go to entertain yourself?

With all her coworkers gone for the weekend, no way of contacting the outside world, and no hint of rescue in sight, Serena will discover that maybe, just maybe, her best friend is actually herself. And these puppets she just made from her socks... 	  Having locked herself in a stairwell, Serena is quickly beginning to run out of distractions. Thankfully, she has two colorful socks and a penchant for amusing herself. You choose a pair of socks and to pass the time Serena will weave short, humorous skits based on your selections, with storylines ranging from romantic melodrama between Princess and Stable Boy to merciless quarrels between an evil Wizard and spooky Ghost. 	 Put A Sock In It!  is free to play, free to enjoy, free to share and spread the love... of socks.

"ReTech   This is ReTech, a game I have been developing on my own over a year now. It is an open-world survival game, in a low poly art style. At the moment, you can explore the map, collect resource and craft new items, and much more.   You obviously have to survive somehow. You can find vital resources in various locations around the map, or you can hunt your own food.   But nothing is easy when having to survive on your onw! To get to the stuff you want, you have to defeat enemies defending important locations. You can do this with your weapon of choice, ranging from machetes to sniper rifles.   If you found a good spot and have the basic resources needed to survive, you can also start building your own base. Chop down wood and stone to create your shelter!   This version of the game contains all the base features that a survival game need. At the moment you can:   Explore a cool large map  Gather resources in the environment (rocks, tree stumps and fallen trees are harvestable)  Fight enemies in town locations to get to the loot you want  Scavenge for food and water to keep yourself alive  Craft tools, components, building parts and much more to suit your needs  Build a base, to have some shelter at night   In future releases, I will add stuff like farming and automation, electricity production and exciting machines, so stay put!  I really want to create a game that everybody likes, so if you have a suggestion, just write a short review on  the feedback page .  You can also check out my  YouTube channel , where I post funny videos of the game every now and then  Cheers,  Federico, developer of ReTech  Tutorial  Don't know how to play? Don't worry, here's a little explanation of how to get started.  More info on  http://www.retechgame.com/wiki.php .  Controls   Loot  Loot spawns at various locations around the map. Once collected, it will respawn in 15 minutes. Usually the same type of loot is found in a specific location, for example, rifler will spawn in military hangars, whereas food will spawn in civilian houses.  Resources  To gather wood, find one of these and chop them down with your tool of choice: Fallen tree: Or tree stump: To get stone and metal ores find these rocks:   The rest of the stuff in game isn't harvestable at the moment. However, you can remove blocks you placed with the same method  you use to gather resources.  Crafting  To craft something, you first need a crafting workbench, like the ""carpenter bench"". Then, you simply drag the items needed in the crafting inventory and select the item you want to craft. Click ""Craft"" and your item will begin crafting. Every craftable item has to be crafted at a specific workbench. Most workbenches can be crafted in the ""tool station"" workbench.  Here's a list of all the recipes:    I recommend you to look at it on  http://www.retechgame.com/wiki.php , since it's wider and better to see there.  Building  Building parts can be acquired by finding them as loot or by crafting them out of wood parts. To build, simply equip the structure. A preview will appear, indicating where it will go. If it is green, it can be placed. Press  Left Mouse Button  to rotate a structure.  Structures or any other blocks can be removed using a tool like ""stick and stone"" or a pick.",Adventure||Survival,3D||combat||Crafting||Exploration||free||Low-poly||open-alpha||Open World||tech,ReTech,fedj99.itch.io/retech

"Feel Gear is like if you mixed Grand Theft Auto with Binding of Isaac, and then mixed that with Dance Dance Revolution.  The original aim was to wrap music making software inside of a game, and what it became is far more than that.  Feel Gear boasts fully procedural open worlds, with fully procedural cities where you can explore any of the procedurally generated buildings while changing the procedurally generated music as you progress.  Strong emphasis has been placed on integrating every aspect of music making into the game world to allow for an immersive experience, and if you don't necessarily want to make music, that's cool, because that's only part of the allure of Feel Gear.  The games twin stick controls feel great when you're leveling up against enemy hordes.  You'll quickly understand why the games tagline is 'Make music, save the world!'.  Meet the characters     This is Bass Boy, he can generate procedural basslines for your songs.  He also has increased attack power against enemies.

"During the assault on a mysterious facility, a genetic experiment called Rane gets the chance to escape. However, to make it outside she'll have to pass through all the dangerous areas of the facility, fight hostile genetic experiments, and defeat the ones who've held her captive.  Though, having been trapped and experimented on for years, she'll use the full extent of her abilities and stealth skills to make it out in one piece.   What is Geneticognito?  Geneticognito is a 2D platformer, with both combat and stealth mechanics. Levels consist of hazards that can either damage Rane or detect her. If Rane is detected, security robots will appear through doors, and the exit door to the level locks itself. Rane may fight the security robots and shoot them down, but unlimited amounts of robots will continue spawning while in Alert. So stealth is important!

Elysis is a top-down action-RPG which aims to provide a gratifying sense of combat and exploration.   To achieve this, the addon system was conceived as a way to allow players to modify their weapons to be able to fight a wide variety of enemies. These addons will give weapons special properties and will be scattered throughout the world waiting to be found.   The game is being worked on by just me, Fervir, and I do all the art, sounds and put all of my ideas together with the Construct Classic engine. I'm starting to get into the music part of the game now, but for the most part, it is handled by @iyashi_kei.  This demo is more of a tech demo where you'll be able to get a taste of what kinds of items and monsters there are in the game as well as some dungeon exploration.

"Take care of a group of travelers on a post-apocalyptic road-trip across the United States in this turn-based survival game. Fight scary creatures, rescue stranded survivors, and scavenge for supplies like fuel, first aid kits, and weapons. Decide where to go next, whether it's upgrading this wrecked car, or rescuing that dog. Just remember, there are consequences for every action. Get ready for close calls, dramatic escapes, hard choices, arguing about whether or not that dog gets rescued, and the end of the world.  Features:  Always keep fuel in the tank. Stay away from the creatures. Be careful. Be quiet. Loud sounds attract trouble, and there's no way you can fight them all. Grab as much gas as you can, rescue that trapped stranger, and get back in the car before it's too late. Travel West, through grasslands, over mountains, across deserts, and to even stranger places. Every level, roadmap, and character is randomly generated, so each trip is new. Equip dozens of items, including medkits, shields, axes, potted plants, scavenged armor, and luggage racks. Twitch integration lets your viewers join in on your journey, allowing for interactive map voting and swapping out the game's random characters for your audience, with their chat being translated into in-game dialog.

"Settle an argument or make friends by challenging them in a cute and simple arcade game! Head It!  is an art project/game I worked on from September 2016 - December 2016 for my Senior Exhibition.  This game does NOT have a single player mode , so you HAVE to find friends or enemies. People usually end up being one or the other.  It should be played on a  single computer with both players sharing the local keyboard. (WASD for Player 1 and Arrow Keys for Player 2.) Each game is only 60 seconds, which is perfect for quick rematches or Round-Robin style elimination at parties. You can toggle the conversation prompts on and off by pushing S or Down key, and the Tutorial can be toggled by pushing T.  This game is completely free, and all I ask is that you do not claim it as your own or directly monetize off of it (selling related merch, selling the game, etc) because that's uncool.

You must get 2 dozens of eggs and leave the house to give to Bart, but you can only carry a half dozen at a time so you'll have to make 4 trips inside the house and out, also the night will get progressively harder as the night goes on.. with cutscenes after each level that connect into a story of loss and a mystery left unsolved. It won't be easy, as you're not the only one who needs eggs, such as Marge. Only eggs can sustain her and she will go after you and try to take you and your eggs. However she's not the only one who needs e g g . . .    After the events of chapter 1, the Simpsons have gone missing without a trace. However, a certain worried neighbor takes matters into his own hands and goes looking for them himself.  It seems as though he's been gone for a while though..

Known Issues  When a  gamepad is connected via USB and Bluetooth simultaneously (e.g. a PS4 controller), it will act as two distinct gamepads. If this happens to you, choose one or the other: disconnect from bluetooth or unplug from USB. PADDLE FORCE runs best in Chrome and support for other browsers is highly experimental for now. Sometimes, you're unable to select gamepads for both players on the splash page. However, this does not affect your ability to use them in-game.

Cheating will stop sending your rank (but will politely ask).  * Not all sites support ranking.  2019-04-30  Added ability to view the ending again after seeing it once.

"Hi, it's me, Valerie! I'm glad you visited this page. Let me tell you something about myself. I am just a regular girl who works at a coffee shop and loves her job. Seeing the happy faces of customers when I serve them their favorite drinks is a thing that makes me happy too. I am still a bit clumsy at the job, but I try to improve every day :D  Around this time of year, it gets really stressful in the coffee shop and sometimes we have to deal with difficult customers. Despite all that I am really motivated. Could you help me to make this day at work a success? ;)   Gameplay:   Play as Valerie, a waitress at a small coffee shop. Help her to make her day successful and customers happy by giving them what they want. Customers will issue their orders to you and your job is it to serve them a cup of delicious coffee (or sometimes they are fine with just milk or sugar too). They get mad and will leave if you give them the wrong ingredients or too much of a certain ingredient. Some customers are also impatient, so you have to hurry to complete their order or they will just leave.   Make as many customers as possible happy by serving them properly. Making customers happy makes you happy and will also increase the profit of the coffee. They are more likely to come back to the coffee shop and who knows.. maybe they will bring some friends too!

"Command, combine, conquer  Two players control groups of wizards, skirmishing to obtain supremacy on the field. Many spells are available to be cast, each one offering multiple combinations with the others, allowing the most clever of the players to overwhelm their foe with unexpected maneuvers. Command your wizards, combine their powers and conquer your well deserved victory.  The game  HexCasters  is a turn based strategy game for two. Each controls a team of wizards, whose objective is to destroy its adversary's orb, or to wipe their forces from the battlefield.  In order to do so, one must carefully consider the positions of their wizards and keep aware of the distances between them. Create your own strategies with spell combinations, or benefit yourself from your foe's carelessness to surprise them.  The game is designed with competition in mind. No randomness in the casting of spells, and all possible information is revealed to both players. This way, only the most clever and adaptable of tacticians will achieve victory.   Comande, combine, conquiste  Dois jogadores controlam grupos de magos e competem pela supremacia no campo de batalha.

"Evolution RTS  Evolution RTS is a free an Open Source RTS game designed using the Spring Engine. It has been in development for over 5 years and receives updates often. Its gameplay is designed specifically to appeal to gamers of all skill levels. The gameplay is designed around the use of unit groups, and the mixture of your unit group often will determine how successful you are in battle, as opposed to churning out hundreds of the same unit continually.  The economy and teching system is easy to learn and use. The game itself supplies many tools that make managing your economy easier so that you can focus more on crushing your enemy than of playing simcity in your base. Units interact using realistic physics and varied terrain (you can actually micro units in order to dodge projectiles!).  Join our discord!  https://discord.gg/WUbAs2f  Features  Fun for casual players  Gameplay designed around being easy to learn yet hard to master. As a newbie you can be up and running in no time, and the gameplay ensures that just because you are new, you aren’t necessarily at a huge disadvantage.  Realistic Projectile Physics  Projectiles and units use a realistic physics system which allow for unprecedented control and gameplay. Micro your units to avoid projectiles. Hide behind terrain for cover.  Epic and Macro scales  Control the battlefield and a level that feels the most comfortable to you, whether zoomed in controlling individual units, zoomed out viewing the entire map and issuing orders on a macro scale, or somewhere in between! You are in complete control!  Intelligent Unit Targeting AI  Units automatically target the best enemy units to attack on their own, leaving you to concentrate on formations, flanking, and commanding your army!  Easy Battle Formations  Unit formations can be literally drawn by selecting a group of units, right clicking and drag whatever formation you want!  Fine tuning controls for builders  Set builders on repeat so that they repeat the orders you give infinitely until they die. Adjust builder priority in order to control the amount of resources allocated to that specific builder’s construction project.  Unique Cover System  Hide your army in rocks and foilage completely undetected and lie in wait to ambush your enemy!  Hundreds of units at once  The Spring Engine allows for hundreds or thousands of units to be beating the daylights out of each other all at once. Gameplay scales seamlessly to fit!  Unique unit abilities  Discover units with special abilities, such as the ORB with it’s incredible area healing abilities, or the Overseer with it’s EMP ability!  Simple Economy  The economy is designed to be easy to learn, and use. There are only two resources in the game; Energy and Metal. Energy is used for utility purposes such as unit ammunition, powering shields, and building nuclear missiles, whereas metal is used to construct structures and units. Metal income is split between allies and resources that overflow the player’s capacity automatically flow into allies banks.  Easy to learn teching system  Simple teching system allows you to tech up easily with just a single facility, instead of requiring a daisy chain of various buildings.  Incredible effects  Full particle effects engine and beautiful effects painstakingly created down to the last detail ensure that every battle will be visually stunning!  Full Soundtrack  Full in-game soundtrack that highlights the mood whether you are building structures in your base or engaged in an all out no holds barred war for survival will keep you on your toes and fuel your need for dominance! Over 20+ tracks!  Give orders via the mini-map  Full unit orders can be given via the minimap, so you can control your units intuitively no matter where your camera is pointing.  Place map markers with or without labels, and draw directly on the map  Map markers, drawing, and labels make it easy for you and your allies to communicate your battle plans, and illustrate them!  Intelligent builder AI  Builders have a plethora of tools and options available to use to help you with macro tasks so that you can focus on kicking robotic ass!  Customizeable GUI  The in-game gui can easily be moved around, resized, and position exactly how you like it! Be your own boss!

Balance & Tweaks: Added more rooms to caves and changed existing ones. Frighten now cancels overwatch\attack of opportunity. Dialogues camera movement made faster. Narrow hallways, the greatest bane of enormous spiders, are now less likely to occur. Also made enormous spiders slightly less enormous so they can pass narrow hallways anyhow.

Removed ""feature"" of opening chests through walls. Fixed missing interact animation of Gharbarak. Fixed issues with frighten (units moving to the same position and units moving even though they are stunned) Fixed poison visuals remaining after the effect wore off. Fixed run + melee attack not always detecting properly whether it's possible to attack from a given position. Fixed potions sometimes spawning in invalid positions (most notably when killing Gharbarak inside the barracks). Fixed bug that caused unit hover UI to show in cinematic camera. Fixed color of unit markers not updating properly to reflect amount of action points left. Replaced grapple hook icon.  Greetings adventurers!

"Caves of Qud  is a science fantasy roguelike epic steeped in retrofuturism, deep simulation, and swathes of sentient plants. Come inhabit an exotic world and chisel through a layer cake of thousand-year-old civilizations. Decide: is it a dying earth, or is it on the verge of rebirth?  Who are you?  	Play the role of a mutant indigenous to the salt-spangled dunes and jungles of Qud, or play a pure-strain descendant from one of the few remaining eco-domes—the toxic arboreta of Ekuemekiyye, the Holy City; the ice-sheathed arcology of Ibul; or the crustal mortars of Yawningmoon.  	You arrive at the oasis-hamlet of Joppa, along the far rim of Moghra'yi, the Great Salt Desert. All around you, moisture farmers tend to groves of viridian watervine. There are huts wrought from rock salt and brinestalk. On the horizon, Qud's jungles strangle chrome steeples and rusted archways to the earth. Further and beyond, the fabled Spindle rises above the fray and pierces the cloud-ribboned sky.  	You clutch your rifle, or your vibroblade, or your tattered scroll, or your poisonous stinger, or your hypnotized goat. You approach a watervine farmer—he lifts the brim of his straw hat and says, ""Live and drink, friend.""  What can you do?  	Anything and everything. 	 Caves of Qud  is a deeply simulated, biologically diverse, richly cultured world.  	 Assemble your character from over 70 mutations and defects, 24 castes and kits, and dozens of cybernetic implants —outfit yourself with wings, two heads, quills, four arms, flaming hands, or the power to clone yourself—it's all the character diversity you could want. 	 Explore procedurally-generated regions with some familiar locations —each world is nearly 1 million maps large. 	 Dig through everything —don't like the wall blocking your way? Dig through it with a pickaxe, or eat through it with your corrosive gas mutation, or melt it to lava. Yes, every wall has a melting point. 	 Hack the limbs off monsters —every monster and NPC is as fully simulated as the player. That means they have levels, skills, equipment, faction allegiances, and body parts. So if you have a mutation that lets you, say, psionically dominate a spider, you can traipse through the world as a spider, laying webs and eating things. 	 Pursue allegiances with over 60 factions —apes, crabs, robots, and highly entropic beings—just to name a few. 	 Follow the plot to Barathrum the Old , a sentient cave bear who leads a sect of tinkers intent on restoring technological splendor to Qud. 	 Learn the lore —there's a story in every nook, from legendary items with storied pasts to in-game history books written by plant historians. A novel's worth of handwritten lore is knit into a procedurally-generated history that's different every game. 	 Die — Caves of Qud  is brutally difficult and deaths are permanent. Don't worry, though—you can always roll a new character.  Words about  Caves of Qud  “There’s a sense of magnificent history to dredge from its depths.” -Chris Priestman,  Kill Screen  “ Caves of Qud  is one of the best roguelikes in years, packed with evocative prose and featuring a captivating world of arcane secrets to explore.” -Heather Alexandra,  Kotaku  “Narratively, this is one of the most compelling game stories that I’ve seen in a long time.” -Charlie Hall,  Polygon  “ Caves of Qud  has a particular kind of New Wave science fiction imagination that just can’t be beat.” -Cameron Kunzelman,  Paste Magazine Soundtrack The soundtrack can be purchased here:  https://freeholdgames.itch.io/caves-of-qud-soundtrack",Role Playing,Fantasy||Roguelike||Sci-fi,Caves of Qud,freeholdgames.itch.io/cavesofqud

It's inspired by games like Dark Souls. I developed it for a small game development event in my town.  Playtime is between 15 and 60 minutes, depending on your skill and experience. The game is meant to be played with a mouse!  In its current version it features three bosses, a tutorial, several weapons and a few spells. There are also a bunch of items like keys, potions, tokens and notes. There are also some eastereggs and secrets. The game is mostly supported by sound and music. Your progess will be saved.  You get experience from enemies to level up and spend them on four attributes: Power, Swiftness, Resistance and Willpower that have a small impact on your playthrough. The combat is based on Mana. It's used to cast spells and to dodge attacks. But it will only be restored when you are dealing damage with a melee weapon to an enemy to keep combat interesting.  Let me know what you think and have fun. :)  Note: Gamepad is currently NOT supported!  ____________________________________________  Anmerkung:  Ich habe auch ein paar andere Spiele entwickelt:  https://just2d.itch.io/coopcrawler  https://just2d.itch.io/soul-chomper __________________________________________________________ Seal Breaker ist ein kleines, düsteres Action-RPG, das durch Spiele wie Dark Souls inspiriert wurde.

RAR files will require a program like WinRAR to open.  Make sure to  extract the game to its own folder  instead of running directly from the RAR file, as this will cause issues with saving and other things.  If you're having issues with the startup (permanent black screen etc.), it may be that your anti-virus software has removed some important files. Try redownloading the game.  If redownloading the game doesn't help, the issue could be within the JS files responsible for plugins and various other things.

"“Summed up in a single word, it would be ‘beautiful.’” — David Wolinsky, Common Sense Media “An introspective ‘Oregon Trail’” — David G. Allan, CNN “A remarkable experiment in translation. As contemplative as its source material, it forces an anti-reflexive pace and coddles at its center an appreciation of calm and quiet.”  — Jason Sheehan, NPR Reading the Game  	 Play as philosopher and naturalist Henry David Thoreau in his experiment in self-reliant living at Walden Pond. Live off the land, seek out the small wonders and beauties of the woods, and find balance between your need to survive and your desire to find inspiration.   	 Walden, a game  is a six hour, exploratory narrative that begins in the summer of 1845 when Thoreau moved to the Pond and built his cabin there. You follow in his footsteps, surviving in the woods by finding food and fuel and maintaining your shelter and clothing.  	At the same time as you strive to survive off the land, you are encouraged to explore the beauty of the woods and the pond, which hold a promise of a sublime life beyond your basic needs. And, you can interact with characters from Thoreau's life including mentor Ralph Waldo Emerson, sister Sophia Thoreau, editor Horace Greeley, activist A. Bronson Alcott, naturalist Louis Agassiz among others.  The game follows the loose narrative of Thoreau's first year in the woods, with each season holding its own challenges for survival and possibilities for inspiration. It features the voices of Emile Hirsch (Into the Wild, Milk) as Henry David Thoreau, Jim Cummings (Darkwing Duck, Sonic the Hedgehog) as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Misty Lee (The Last of Us, BioShock Infinite), and Tony Amendola (Stargate SG-1, Once Upon a Time) as Bronson Alcott.  Walden, a game has been a labor of love by a very small core team working over the past ten years. We sincerely hope you enjoy the experience and welcome your feedback!

"Pax Britannica is a one-button real-time strategy game by  No Fun Games . Up to four players battle it out underwater, struggling to be the last one standing! The game was created for the   GAMMA4  one-button design competition in 2010, and has been featured at  Kill Screen Arcade  (during SXSW) and  Prince of Arcade .   How to Play  The A, F, H, and L keys control the four players, and the escape key quits. Gamepads are also supported, although not on OS X (sorry).    Holding down the button spins the needle on the radial menu in the middle of the player's factory ship. The needle will only travel as far as the player's current resources allow. Resources (gold? seaweed? who knows!) accumulate over time.    Releasing the button creates a ship that corresponds to the quadrant that the needle is pointing at.        Fighter: Small, fast and cheap. Great at chasing down bombers.       Bomber: Shoots slow projectiles that do massive damage to frigates or enemy factory ships!       Frigate: A great hulk of a ship that fires volleys of heat-seeking torpedoes. Effective against fighters.       Upgrade: Improve your factory ship to accumulate resources more quickly.      Ships you spawn fight automatically using the latest in artificial aquatelligence technology. The player who keeps their factory ship alive wins!

"Heat Death  An arcade-style highscore-focused twin stick shooter. In my experience it runs best in Chrome, but should be playable in most modern browsers.  How to play  Dual Stick Controls  The dual stick controls with a gamepad are the recommend way to play. Visit  https://html5gamepad.com/  to see if your browser supports your gamepad (you may have to unplug it, plug it back in, and press some buttons for it to be recognized).  You may also play dual stick with the keyboard, but there are a lot of buttons so it can be a bit tricky!  You can remap your controller or the keyboard controls by pressing the controller icon to the right of the game window after pressing play.   If you have an Xbox-style controller, the default mapping is as follows:   ""Simple"" Controls  If you don't have a gamepad with two sticks or you prefer to use fewer buttons on the keyboard, you can try the simple controls! You will automatically aim in the opposite direction you're moving so that you can shoot enemies chasing you. If you hold shoot, you will lock your aim in place and strafe. Let go of shoot to aim somewhere else.  You can remap your controller or the keyboard controls by pressing the controller icon to the right of the game window after pressing play.    Rules  Objective: gain heat by shooting enemies Collect power gems to fill the power bar   Hold power button to charge ability (1...2...3)   Release power button to spend power on numbered ability  Number/Cost Ability Name Description Video 1 power Defrag Collects debris in an area and converts it to firepower. The number of extra shots you get is directly proportional to the amount of debris it collects, so try to place it where it can collect the most. 2 power Cloak Briefly prevent enemies from chasing and aiming at you. If all players are cloaked, enemies will move towards and shoot at random locations. 3 power Remote Backup Creates a backup on the field which prevents one death. Instead of dying, you will be teleported to the backup you most recently placed. You can have up to 5 backups on the field at a time.  Tips  Position yourself to kill high-value targets at the beginning of each level. You are briefly invulnerable right when enemies spawn. Look for the flashing cross on your ship. Dying resets your power to 2, so use your abilities proactively to avoid wasting power. Use defrag liberally; it's the least expensive and it's the only ability that directly increases your offense. You are not invulnerable while cloaked; be careful around erratically moving enemies. You are briefly invulnerable after a remote backup triggers. Follow the line to find yourself after the teleport so you can regain control before the invulnerability runs out. Remote backups are expensive; sometimes it's better to prioritize offense over defense. You slowly lose heat over time; play faster to get higher scores. Chain gems by collecting them the instant they flash your color for bonus points. The gray number near the top left of the HUD is the heat remaining until you're award an extra life. Some enemies drop green slime when they die. Slime will slow you down when you move through it, so try to avoid those areas or use defrag to clean them up. Look at the post game stats to figure out where you're dying and what you could do better!

With visions of happiness in their mind, Seer leaves everything behind and ventures to the part of the land fraction where those without magic live; Normal society.  Seer is going to convince this stranger that they are meant to be together no matter what it takes, even if it means tagging along on an adventure.  In only a few days Seer will learn just how far away that pleasant future is.    ⚜ Features:  -150,000 word script (9-15 hours of playtime in total)  -3 future spouse options (one male, one female, one agender)  -Choose pronouns (he, she, or they) and a 'Normal' name for Buffalo Seer  -Partial Voice Acting  -A variety of choices, all of which are worth choosing  -Light animation effects & over 25 CG images  -A fun alternate outfit mode DLC   ⚜ Cast List :  Kea:  Lily Chen  Piper:  Hannah Hellwig  January:  Oakesy (Andrew Oakes)  Trinette:  Stephanie Tobin  Felicity:  Kimberly Ismael   A Foretold Affair is a customizable story rather than a fully branching one. While the general plot points will stay much the same, the specific interactions and conversations will change constantly based on your choices.  Warning:  The game includes violence, blood (more than an insignificant amount), and some swearing. It may not be suitable for all ages. Player discretion is advised.    This game was created using the Ren'Py Engine   ⚜ Alt Outfit DLC:  At one point the three future spouse options have to wear clothing different than their usual ones. Those outfits just so happen to be their underwear. With quality pieces like that, we couldn't help but give people the option to use them all the time. With this DLC you'll be able to freely swap back and forth between the normal and alt outfits at any time and control individually which of the three characters wear what.   To unlock the feature simply purchase the DLC along with the game, extract the zip files for the game and DLC, and then add the DLC.rpy from the DLC zip to the 'game' folder from the A Foretold Affair zip.  Using alternate outfits  will not  change CG images or the script, only the character sprites will be altered.   This DLC is totally non-essential. It's just to add a bit more fun to those who find this kind of thing amusing/appealing.

How to play  The game is very well explained in  this video  by  ToneHack . This game is about racing to the exit (the stairs) of a dungeon floor. Your goal is to reach the stairs before your opponents do. You loose if your rank is 7th or worse. Better ranking gives better score. There is no combat. You can pick up the following items: /  $  : Coins give score  /  *  : Permanent Speed-Upgrade by 10% /  !  : Nitro - Doubles your speed for 10 turns, when ignited. /  ~  : Drill - Allows you to destroy a wall.  {new in v0.2} At the beginning you and your opponents all move with the same speed. The speed of your opponents increases with every dungeon-level. Your opponents can only move in  4  directions whereas you can move in  8  directions (including diagonal movement). Diagonal movement enables you to cut corners and use shorter paths when traversing rooms! There are 4 possibilities to overtake opponents: Take advantages of your diagonal movement in rooms. Find a shorter path. Increase your speed by speed-upgrades or nitros. Dig your own shortcut using a drill.   {new in v0.2} You are supported by a magic  navigation system : One possible path to the stairs is always indicated by a colored trace. Be aware: This path is calculated considering 4-way-movement! Therefore it is by no means ideal when you are capable of 8-way-movement! Always consider alternative routes in order to take advantage of your ability to walk diagonal. How digging works:   {new in v0.2} You need at least one drill "" ~ "" in order to be able to dig. If you have a drill, you can press  [ctrl]  or  [0]  to start digging-mode. When in digging-mode, the  @ -sign representing the player is displayed in yellow and the walls are displayed as ""#""-signs to allow better counting. Your movement speed is halved as long as you are in digging-mode. Just bump into a wall to remove it. The removal of every wall-tile consumes one drill. You automatically leave digging-mode when you move towards an empty square. You can collect as many drills as you like. This allows you to dig long tunnels by investing the corresponding amount of drills.  Examples how overtaking works  Overtaking by diagonal movement  See how I manage to overtake 2 other runners by moving diagonal.    This was very close but it worked since I could cut the corner! :-)  Overtaking by taking another route  Here I am overtaking runner H by taking another route so Runner H does not block my way (shown in ASCII-mode).   Overtaking by igniting a nitro  Here I doubled my speed by igniting  a nitro in order to overtake 2 opponents. My character turns into a fireball while the nitro is burning!   Overtaking by digging a shortcut using a drill  {new in v0.2}  Here I am overtaking 3 other guys by digging a shortcut using a drill.  My character turns into a drill while digging.     How to have fun in your first games  Play fast and don't worry too much about perfect movement - it's a racing game! ;-) Just follow your navigation system. Only pick up Items if they lie directly on your way. If you are stuck in traffic, just follow the other runners until there are larger rooms which allow overtaking by diagonal movement. Don't worry about score too much. Just focus on overtaking in your first games and watch yourself climb the rankings shown at the right side of the screen. Just race like this (shown in ASCII-mode):     How to get a high score  In this game you get points in the following situations: When you pick up coins. When you finish races (when you reach the stairs). The points you get for finishing races depend on your ranking:  Ranking Points 1 10 2 6 3 4 4 3 5 2 6 1 7-9 0  Getting no points in a race also means Game Over for the player. Picking up many Speed-Upgrades and Nitros may help you to survive later levels when your opponents move faster. But be aware that surviving 10 levels ranked 6th gives you as many points as one time finishing 1st! So there is always a  trade-off  between taking the shortest path and making a detour in order to pick up an item. I'm very curios to find out what scores would be possible in my game. So I would be pleased if you could post your high-scores in the comments below! :-)   High-Score-Table  Rank Version Who Score Dungeon Level Video Comments / Strategy / Great Moments 1 v0.7 Jmath 247 🏆 23  🥉 ""Finally got to the top spot! At one point I had over 43 nitros stockpiled."" 🏆 Current world record of RunToTheStairs! 🏆 Achievement 🥉earned for  3rd  best dungeon level result! 2 v0.3 RantotheStairs 244 21 see video	 A neat maneuver where he overtakes two guys by digging trough a wall can be watched  here . 3 v0.3 RantotheStairs 243 20 ""Finally. Now I can live. 243. Level 20. Your move."" ""Funny enough, I was actually about to leave for a long commute so this was a bit of a speed-run, I'd say about 20min.  I wish I could remember my speed after lvl1, it was either 160 or 170, and I used nitros excessively in the first 6 or 7 rounds so I could cover lots of ground. Such a great game.  V0.3  is great,  drills  were a genius next step."" 4 v0.4 Jmath 240 22 ""I've played since the game first came out, but didn't have an account to post my scores. I can usually get around 200 in a 30-45 minute game session after work. I quit any game that I don't have a speed of at least 200 by the end of level 2."" 5 v0.3 Webmant 229 21 ""Very well designed game, makes it very difficult to make some decisions."" 6 v0.0 Steffen1337 220 21 ""Looks like it´s  InfuriatedBrute 's turn to beat that ;D ... So as for strategy: Always get permanent speed upgrades. Use Nitros in earlier levels to gain access to a permanent speed boost and still finish first. Restart first level until you have at least 190% permanent speed after first level. This way you have plenty of room in the next 5 levels to get all the upgrades and still easily finish first. On this try I had been 3 times as fast as the enemies on end of level 3. That being said - I´m eager to see who is obsessed enough to get above 500 points or to level 25 first ;D""   I really like how  Steffen1337 ,  JohannesvH  and  InfuriatedBrute  maxed out my game! Steffen has even written a mathematical treatise about RunToTheStairs in  this post ! 7 v0.0 JohannesvH 213 22 ""I am getting closer... New level record"" ""I just had 160% in the first round. Maybe I should be more patient for restarting it until I have more in the first round. I think the key to getting a lot of points is also to collect a lot of $ (whenever you can) especially in the first rounds where you're much faster than the others."" 8 v0.1 RantotheStairs 211 20 1090% speed! 9 v0.2 JohannesvH 204 20 ""Sometimes you can really use the  drills  to your advantage. Nice new feature! I think 220 is definitely beatable..."" 10 v0.4 Flooderbenga 202 19 ""Should have looked for more ways of using drills instead of just spamming nitros in later levels. Surprising how speed boost is nearly worthless in later levels but crucial in early ones. Really like this game :)"" 11 v0.2 myself 188 21 I achieved this score while playtesting  v0.2 . 12 v0.3 Aix0 187 20 ""I got 187 points after 20 races. Maybe highest possible for me!"" 13 v0.0 InfuriatedBrute 186 19 ""Strategy: Log stats,  nitros -> 2$ is fine at any point, lategame go for $ over position, block enemies if they're faster than you, prefer open corridors as they give more opportunities for items (even if you can't see anything). Oh yeah, and restart until you get an upgrade in the first room."" 14 v0.0 JohannesvH 180 19 You have improved a lot compared to your first try.

From last to first place - what a huge shortcut! :-) 22 v0.0 owlmoth  /  astroskag 148 21 see video ""Not the top of the leaderboard, but I'm pretty proud of it. The way I'm kind of mentally strategizing is while I'm faster than the other runners, saving nitros and getting boosts at all costs. Once the other runners are faster than me, I only burn nitros when I'm out of the top 6. I broke my own rules in  level 9 , though, diverting just before the finish line to pick up a boost that was way off track, and then burning nitros so I'd be able to catch up before the end of the race; I don't know if it was worth it."" 23 v0.3 xyncht 144 17 ""Game is very fun!  Given your current leaderboard, may come back for a second playthrough and see if I can get top 10 ;)   Boosts are a big deal, of course, but the exponential enemy speed growth means that past level 14ish it doesn't much matter if your speed gets another ~2% improvement-- nitros (and maybe drills, haven't used those effectively yet) are the only things keeping you alive.  Also for the last several levels of a run, when you're barely making it each time, coins are where your points come from.  And when you know you're dead, it's time to fetch coins till the ref calls the game on account of everyone else finishing."" 24 v0.4 Xylenox 137 20 25 v0.4 gim 137 17 ""this time I was trying to reach higher in terms of level, but at some point it becomes pretty complicated"" 26 v0.4 gim 136 21 ""trying to get deeper, but it's really hard. would ""almost"" reach 22, but was I was one nitro short "" 27 v0.2 nobusawa 135 17 ""I was finally able to beat my previous score, grabbing every speed boost I could find helped a lot but it seemed like sometimes they just weren't there or were so far away that I never saw them."" 27 v0.0 tcookiem 135 17 ""This game is kind of addictive. Main strategy was to go for any speed upgrade I saw on the earlier levels and most nitros, then I had about 550% saved up for when they overtook me in speed.

A nice sequence of moves resulting in two overtakes by cutting corners can be seen  here .  Please post your score and dungeon level in the comments below and you will get listed here.   If your score would be the new top score of this table it would be nice if you could also provide a screenshot of your game-over-screen.  Balancing  This is a score-based game with an infinite number of levels. If you do not know how speed can work in a turn-based game: I implemented the speed-mechanic using the "" Speed scheduler "" of the rot.js library. In each new level the speed of all opponents is increased according to the following table:  Dungeon Level Opponent Speed Increase 1 100% 2 105% 5% 3 115% 10% 4 130% 15% 5 150% 20% ... ... ...  As you can see, this is an  nonlinear  function since the increase of the speed also increases! The increase of the players speed is on the other hand limited by the amount of Speed-Upgrades he finds. Since the number of Speed-Upgrades does not increase from level to level, this means that the player will at some point no longer be able to catch up to the opponents and will eventually loose. The better the player performs, the farther he gets and the higher his score will be. In order to prevent all opponents from using the same path they sometimes get "" confused "" and take alternative paths which are inferior to the shortest path. This lowers the difficulty and enables the player to get ahead of them even with lower speed. Confused opponents change their color to magenta. The  items  are somehow  automatically balanced  due to the game mechanic: E.g. if I decided to double the bonus of a certain item this would only affect the maximal length of a detour an optimal playing player would take into account in order to get this item. The possibility of digging allows the player to take greater risks when taking alternative routes, since this will enable him to rescue himself by spending some resources (drills) if his route decision turns out to be wrong.  {new in v0.2}  Roguelike elements  Procedural generated dungeons Permadeath since Game-over means Game-over The whole game is around an  implicit hunger-clock  since you inevitably loose if you lurk around too long in one level. Turn-based Grid-based Resource management: The player decides when to use his nitros or drills. They can be taken to the next level.  Credits and links  This game was created during the  7DRL Challenge 2019 . I was inspired to take part in this challenge by  Roguelike Radio . The episode covering RunToTheStairs and other games of the the 7DRL Challenge 2019 can be found  here . The episode that inspired me to make a 7DRL myself can be found  here . I used  the JavaScript roguelike-library  rot.js  by  Ondřej Žára . {new in v0.3}  The music was composed by  Dekkanoid . I am absolutely blasted by what this Australian guy created in just few hours! Check out  this playlist  to hear how versatile this guy is!

The idea of having an 8-way moving character outmaneuvering 4-way moving characters is stolen from "" Ananas aus Caracas "". This is a game one develops when doing the  rot.js-tutorial . My game is based on my own version of "" Ananas aus Caracas "" which I kept extending after finishing the tutorial. The animated screenshots where created using the software  ScreenToGif . RunToTheStairs has been covered by the following youtubers: ToneHack : A quite long video which explains the game very well and discusses strategic and tactical decisions.  Rogueliker : This video by a very experienced and quite popular roguelike player gave RunToTheStairs a huge boost in popularity. cubicDisco : Funny video from a very relaxed Australian guy who plays RunToTheStairs blind and learns the game while playing. astroskag : Short but fast-paced video with great music. Nookrium : The shortest video and at the same time the one with the most views. It's fun to watch since you can see Nookriums reactions because he is using a facecam.  Statistics  I have to apologize that the following text will have an accumulation of the word ""amazing"" in it. The reason for this is, that what happened yesterday (25.03.2019) was just absolutely ...  AMAZING!  So I want to share it with you! :-)  As I checked the  most popular web games on itch.io  I found my game RunToTheStairs on  first place  out of  55,563 :     And as I checked the  most popular games without any filter  it was listed  7th  out of  157,274 :     I just could not believe this and thought that my browser was fooling me and somehow biased my game to the top. So I asked some nice guys from  Discord  to check it and they just saw the same screens as I did. Isn't this amazing? I don't know exactly how this popularity ranking works. The best source I found is  here . I just want to thank  Rogueliker  since he boosted the popularity of my game with his nice  video  about it. Just see the huge step the click-rate did after he posted it:   I also like to share with you some geographical data I got from Google Analytics about the countries the users came from (the data also comes from 25.03.2019):        Someone on the Maldives probably played my game. I just can't believe it. Go out and enjoy the sun at the beach... and then come back and play RunToTheStairs again! ;-)  Since most of the players came from the USA I will give a little more detail here:     Hey why is nobody in Alaska playing my game? Somebody has to tell them to do so! ;-)  How clicks evolved since then  Meanwhile RunToTheStairs reached the milestone of 3000 views.   The visitors came from 84 different countries!     Reviews  What the judges think about RunToTheStairs  Following you find the 3 official reviews of the 3 different jam-judges who reviewed my game for the  7DRL Challenge 2019 :  ""This one is quite original. And addictive. And not as simple as you might thing from the description. The only feature that is IMO absolutely required, but missing is the ability to pan the view around. The game is technically all about finding an optimal path that short enough and have number of collectibles maxed. But you can only rely on the very restricted field of view and pathfinder. I wouldn't mind at the very least have some kind of predicted pathfinder, see where it will path if I'll go there. Right now deviation from the main route is always a gamble. There can be different path from that nook, then you are fine, or it can be dead end and then you are screwed. There were roguelikes without combat, there were roguelikes about getting from point A to point B as fast as possible, but in this format, probably not. Let's call it moderately innovative. But I think there could be much more to the game. More upgrades, some way to hinder AI players... As much as the game tries to squeeze into formal rouguelike definition, I think it is too shallow to be called true roguelike."" ""Run to the Stairs is a tidy, small game that adds some nice gamifications around a simple central mechanic. And a quick note up front before discussing the game proper, the author has done a lot around the central game to add to the experience of play: there is a long and interesting description of the mechanics on the game’s page, there are clear information panels in the game itself, and the author has also implemented a sort of bespoke leader board on the itch page, all of which add to the experience. The core mechanic of this game really worked for me – using diagonal movement and player decisions to outsmart pathfinding AI. I also think that it was wise of the author to focus on refining this central premise, rather than trying to add too many bells and whistles. The inclusion of the “fastest” line, the granular calculation of racers’ speed, and the simplicity of the power ups all contribute in a clear way to the central experience of racing. I did find myself wishing for slightly more visual polish. The choice of typeface for the ascii-characters I found particularly sharp and vertical, and the colors could have been chosen with more care. More substantially, because the game hinges so completely on moving across corners, some visual indication of the grid would have helped ease the eyes, rather than having rooms and walls exist as just large contiguous sections of black and grey. Regardless, this game is definitely worth a play. "" ""An interesting take on the RL genre, and a well executed one. Little techniques and tricks here and there to get the advantage and good use on the nitro makes it very fun and interesting to play. I would say that it feels overwhelming the more you play by placing the enemy units way ahead and also giving them an increased scaling speed over you that can be really hard to beat. Strategy can take you so far, since you can't see far ahead to calculate better paths and if upgrades worth your position investment. Overall I had a great time playing and it's a concept I would love to see improved on and grow into an actual game.""  I wanna thank the judges for the detailed and constructive feedback!   The reviews of all the exciting games in the challenge can found on  http://roguetemple.com/7drl/2019/ . I want to congratulate  dungeonyak  for winning the challenge with his imaginative game  Inner Life  - a well deserved victory!  Non-official reviews   I also wanna share with you this very nice  comment  by  owlmoth  about which I am very happy:  ""I've been playing a lot the last few days, this is my best score so far. It's a very creative take on the roguelike mechanic to not be combat-based, but stays true to the spirit by maintaining all the high points of the genre like resource management, unlimited replayability, and ""weighty"" risk vs. reward choices - trying to decide if it's worth detouring for a power-up feels meaningful in the context of the game. The gameplay is also a lot snappier than you'd expect from a turn-based game, another departure from the norm that just works really well here. This is what indie games are all about for me; taking some risks, making some less-common design choices, leaving the beaten path and finding a fun little mechanic off in the weeds somewhere.  If I could add anything, it'd only be an 'instant replay' feature; to be able to go back after the end of ;a level and rewatch the race in 'real' time. Thanks for sharing this with us!""  Post challenge development  Version Description v0.0 Submitted version for the   7DRL Challenge 2019 v0.1 - New alternative controls for people lacking a numpad (WASD-QEZC-mode)  - The probability of opponents getting confused has been decreased.  - Opponents now change color if they get confused.  - Opponents already start with some grand-prix-points in order to make it more challenging for the player to climb up the rankings.  - Some colors have been changed. v0.2 The player can now dig tunnels!  For this purpose a new collectible item called ""drill"" was introduced which enables the player to remove one wall element by bumping into it.  The possibility of digging allows the player to take greater risks when taking alternative routes, since this will enable him to rescue himself by spending some resources (drills) if his route decision turns out to be wrong. v0.3 - The game now plays music composed by  Dekkanoid . I am absolutely blasted by what this Australian guy created in just few hours!   - The game now emits one out of 3 burning sounds (random choice) on each step the player takes while burning a nitro.   - I moved the players position on screen towards left in order to increase the field of view since the player mainly moves from left to right.   - Some fixes regarding sound effects. v0.4 - I now use a graphical tiles by  Oryx Design Lab . - It is still possible to play in ASCII-mode. v0.5 EVERY level (until level 22) now got a different tileset!!! v0.6 - There are now more than 300 character-sprites in the game. The sprites of your opponents are randomly chosen at each new game. - The character-sprites and some obstacles are now animated by simple two-frame-animations. - All sprites were drawn by  Oryx Design Lab . v0.7 - The AI opponents recalculate their paths whenever they did not move during their last turn. This prevents opponents from blocking each other into a deadlock. - The AI now does a better job evading the player. It is now very funny to block opponents and see how they take different routes. This, however, is only possible if there exists an alternative route.  - The AI is now more likely to use tunnels that have been dug by the player.  - Fixed a bug where the game crashed before a new level started.  - Fixed a bug where the false character was shown in ASCII-mode. - There are currently no more known bugs! :-) v0.8 - There are now forest-levels of different types.  - EVERY level (until level 27) now got a different tileset!!! - Forest-levels are generated with a different layout to make them feel more organic! - New music featuring strings which is explicitly played in forest-levels. (The music has been composed by  Dekkanoid .) - The players sprite is now also randomly drawn out of a pool of more than 300 sprites whenever a new game begins. (All tiles have been designed by  Oryx Design Lab .) - New graphical layer in the foreground. This is for example useful for displaying spider-webs.  - Simple egg-cracking animation in egg-cave. - Fixed a bug where the wrong character was displayed in ASCII-mode while burning a nitro. v0.9 - The game loads much faster now. - Not all music tracks are loaded on startup. Additional tracks are loaded while others are playing. - JavaScript has been minimized using  Google Closure Compiler .  Plans for the future  I consider to implement the following things:  Providing different music-tracks fitting the themes of the levels. Implementing a server-sided back-end to manage leaderboards and collect statistics. Implementing an achievement-system. Particle effects for nitros and when digging.",Racing,2D||Seven Day Roguelike Challenge||ascii||Minimalist||Procedural Generation||Roguelike||Roguelite||Sci-fi||Turn-based,RunToTheStairs,gerhard-wonner.itch.io/runtothestairs

"Thank you for your interest in Astoria: The Holders of Power Saga!  If you enjoy charming RPGs with epic, twisting storylines, containing intricate characters and cinematic cutscenes done in classic 90's, RPG-style storytelling, then ATHOPS is for you!   Description:  Astoria: The Holders of Power Saga is a charming, classically done RPG with an epic, twisting story, containing highly developed and intricate characters. It's approximately 30 hours of gameplay, with a story driven by intense cutscenes. The game's lore has grown immensely over the course of these 4 years of development, as I've gone back hundreds of years into the history of Astoria to help describe the playable world. This lore will come in handy if you decide to take on some of the more intricate quests of the game - some of the major quests begin at the outset of the  game and aren't completed until a few hours from its end. The magic system is designed to add an extra layer of planning and strategy to combat, by encouraging the player to analyze the visible enemy and its environment, and choose the correct spells to bring into combat.   Story:  One hundred years ago, Astoria was invaded by the Supreme Demon, Buul, and his hordes of Demons. The people of Astoria and mighty King Romulus fought off the invasion as Romulus slew Buul in single combat after he ripped a blue stone from the Demon's armor. Witnesses on the field of battle stated the great Demon shrieked in fear and desperation as Romulus grasped the stone, and they swore it both invigorated him and gave him the strength to slay the massive Demon. After the Demons' defeat, it came to be known as the Stone of Power and it was assumed whoever possessed it would be all-powerful.  After many years of peace and prosperity, when he realized he had grown old, Romulus shattered the Stone into five pieces with his mighty hammer. He distributed the pieces to five individuals with opposing politics and interests to prevent the full Stone from ever being in the hands of the wrong person. These five came to be known as the Holders of Power.  The story begins at a meeting between the five Holders of Power and an unknown, shadowy figure who has evil intentions to re-form the Stone of Power once again.  One of the Holders of Power, the noble knight, Garreth, quickly learns that an assassination plot is afoot, and he and his piece of the Stone are the intended targets...  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Play as Nolan, a young Prince arriving in Astoria from a far away land, desperately seeking reinforcements to defend his country from an invasion. Little does he know, Astoria will soon be in a similar situation. As his envoy quest quickly spirals out of control, he'll meet a colorful cast with their own storylines: Calista, the bubbly clairvoyant whose dreams sometimes predict the future, Petra, the young firebrand whose life will be turned upside down when she witnesses tragedy, the mysterious Cheshire, who arrived in Astoria under his own suspicious circumstances, and a host of other characters willing to lend a hand and fight for their right to survive.  Explore an expansive world where you will encounter hordes of vicious monsters. Conduct stealth missions, fight in a pitched battle, and uncover great mysteries. Experience the emotions of love, anger, hatred, and fear as each member of your party has their own gripping story arcs that intertwine with the main storyline. All of this is done in classic, 90's, RPG-style storytelling.   Features:  The Magic System  The people of Astoria have different ""affinities"" for magic. A party member can learn nearly 100 spells or skills, but each character has a limited number that can be brought into combat... and that defines their affinity. In ATHOPS, the mage and the clairvoyant can each ""memorize"" 8 spells and bring them to combat. The hero, Nolan, has a maximum of 3. The size of your party - which varies from 1 to 6 - and its cast greatly determine the amount and types of spells you bring to combat. Since there are nearly 100 spells... choose wisely. Will you arm your party with powerful elemental spells, amplifying buff spells, crippling debuff spells, or a combination of each for proper balance?   Customization and Replayability  Customize your party via the plethora of powerups found in hidden or guarded treasure chests. Find and slay fantastic beasts and claim their rewards that can be sold for additional equipment upgrades that permanently remain with your desired character. Defeat deadly dragons and choose massive stat bonuses for each character in your party before the dragon's essence dissipates into the air. Swap different weapons, armor, and item combinations among your party members to further customize how they battle. I made it a point to make the player give serious thought into how they wish to build out their party.   Plot-centric Assassination Events  One of the main characters in ATHOPS is the young girl, Petra. She has an arcing storyline that ties in with the main theme, and she vows to become an assassin, to avenge her parents' death. There are two scenes in ATHOPS where you control Petra in real-time assassination events. There are visible enemies on guard, and you have to sneak by them/assassinate them from behind without entering their ""line of sight."" So take your time, notice patterns, and have patience! Remember, assassins never give in to their emotions! Hopefully these will be as enjoyable for you to play as they were for me to make.  - 35+ hours of gameplay  - 20+ side quests (some small and some large, spanning the entire game)  - 220+ maps  - 130+ weapons & armor, 140+ items, 175+ skills/spells (unique enemy skills included)  - A total of 16 party members, constantly moving in and out of the party in accordance with the plot!  - Highly developed main characters with tons of in-game dialogue! - Nearly 1 hour of dramatic, cinematic cutscenes!  - Overworld map/hidden enemies, Dungeon maps/visible enemies  - 2 High action, REAL TIME stealth/assassination events!  - Be challenged by a group of ""heroes"" for status/bragging rights via intense ""hero to hero"" combat!  - Find and fight a total of 6 ""challengers"" inhabiting towns/villages in 1 on 1 combat with no items to test a character's might!  - 9 Dragons to find and kill that grant the party bonus statistics you can distribute to tailor your characters however you like!  - 8 Side quest bosses and their drop items that can be converted into unique equipment upgrades by a specialty blacksmith  System Requirements:  ATHOPS runs on PC MINIMUM: OS: XP Processor: Core 2 Duo Graphics: Discreet Video Card Storage: Demo is 515Mb, Full Release estimated 600Mb) Sound Card: Direct X 9.0 Compatible Soundcard RECOMMENDED: OS: Windows 8.1 Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4200HQ CPU @ 2.4 GHz 2.40 GHz Graphics: Nvidia GEFORCE GTX Storage: 1 GB available space Sound Card: Direct X 9.0 Compatible Soundcard",Role Playing,Action RPG||Fantasy||First-Person||JRPG||Kickstarter||RPG Maker||Story Rich||Strategy RPG||Turn-based Strategy,Astoria: The Holders of Power Saga,golden-unicorn-gaming.itch.io/astoria-the-holders-of-power-saga

"On a summer night, Ophelia awakens from a terrible vision: in four days, everyone in Elsinore Castle will be dead. Even worse, she's been thrown into a time loop from which she cannot escape. Forced to relive the same four days over and over again, Ophelia determines to do everything in her power to change the future.  Elsinore is a time-looping adventure game set in the world of Shakespeare's Hamlet. Elsinore combines strong social simulation elements, a dynamic story that reacts immediately to player decisions, and a world full of diverse characters with secrets to uncover. Can Ophelia prevent the tragedy that lies before her?  Gameplay  Elsinore is a point-and-click adventure game set in a living world where the story plays out around you in real time. Every four days time resets, and you gain another chance to change the fate of Elsinore Castle's inhabitants.  Dynamic Story Engine:  Elsinore uses a story simulation engine to determine which events occur based upon your interactions. Lie, forgive, gossip, befriend, or destroy — the actions you can take at any stage are numerous, and the game immediately responds.  Intelligent Character Behavior:  Each character manages their own lives, schedules, needs, desires, and plans over the course of each time loop. Even the smallest interaction has an impact on the world around you as it unfolds.  Learn from Previous Loops:  Whenever a time loop resets, Ophelia remembers anything she has learned from the previous world, allowing you to access new ways to play.  Use Your Influence:  Understanding each character's motivations isn't just part of the story. It's necessary for Ophelia's survival. Characters are complex and have long histories with each other; all of them are keeping secrets.  Life-or-Death Decisions:  In a Shakespearean world, most roads end in tragedy, and characters are quick to meet a grisly fate. Hard decisions and terrible trials force players to think on their feet.

"Hello everybody, This is Averxy, one of the writers of Heartbaked. I'm very sorry to say that as of, well, awhile ago, Gourmet Visual is no longer together. There will be no more games released by us. Heartbaked is still available to play and download of course, and we allow lets plays to be made, but if you're having issues opening the file, or if you find glitches, we will no longer be updating the game and I'm very sorry about this. If you're interested in games by the same developers, myself and Minyan are still working together under the name ""Fablesoft Studios"", and Minyan is making games on her own as well. Thank you very much for playing our game. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Gourmet Visual's NaNoRenO project! A visual novel in 31 days, started March 1st and completed the 31st.  Time: 5-6 hours  Short version: A  comedic otome game poking fun at the genre set in an elven village whose economy runs entirely around pastries.  Long version: In a beautiful elven village hidden away in a lovely little forest, one pastry chef has just reached the last recipe in a sacred book passed down from her grandmother. Ginger has waited her entire career and quite possibly her life for this, and cannot wait to finally have created everything inside. However, the last recipe requires an ingredient that she doesn't have in her pantry. TRUE LOVE! Ginger must go on a journey to find this true love, hopefully in one of the three admittedly quirky guys she knows. One problem though- she sucks at it. Good luck.  Featuring: + Three boys to awkwardly attempt romance with! Around 20,000 words per route. + 9 endings + 3 CGS + 8 BGs + Original music!  The MC:  Ginger : The protagonist, whose name can be changed. She has three possible personality types depending on player  choices, and each boy will favor a different one.  The Boys:  Radley : Ginger's childhood friend who helps around the store,  but is usually more of a hassle than actually useful due to all of his pranks. He's a complete germaphobe  and is always seen wearing gloves.  Carver : A rude, cheap little jerk who is quite self conscious  about his height. He can be found trying to swindle  people out of pretty much anything in their pockets,  and/or finding excuses to make a mess in Ginger's shop.  Benjamin : New in town and a bit... eccentric. His greatest loves are the two sheep he keeps with him at all times, and he  uses their wool to knit all of his clothing.  Gourmet Visual  Min : Sprite artist, Gui artist, BG artist, Writer (2/3 of Carver's route)  Oktolio: Concept artist, CG artist, Writer (Benjamin's route) Averxy: Writer (Radley's route and 1/3 of Carver's route)  The Team  Antelope: Composer justcolorado: Programmer  Questions: - Did you enjoy it overall? - What was your favorite part? - What parts could be improved upon? - Who was your favorite character? - Would you like to see more games from Gourmet Visual? - Any other random comments!

"Sethian is a sci-fi puzzle game in which you master a fictitious language. An archaeologist in the distant future, you venture to the far-flung planet of Sethian, investigating the mysterious disappearance of the people there centuries ago. An abandoned computer may have the answers you seek, but it only operates in the lost native language. Master their language, unravel their mysteries, and challenge their philosophy. An Original Language  - Unlike in other games, Sethianese is a more earnest attempt at creating a fictitious language, using its own unique grammar and vocabulary rather than simply substituting words and letters one-for-one with English. The game's language borrows elements from Chinese, American Sign Language, and other real world languages, in addition to some features which have no real world counterpart. Over 100 Handwritten Pages  - Assisting you in your investigation are your handwritten journal and dictionary, easing you into the game's bizarre language, providing you with a reliable reference, and introducing you to the literature and lore of the world. Multiple Endings  - Those who comprehend the game's language will find peace, but only those who master its world will truly see the end of Sethian.",Puzzle,language||Sci-fi,Sethian,gqul.itch.io/sethian

Decided to go with Jojo's Bizarre Adventure for source material because I like JJBA, and I figure if I ain't allowed to monetize it no matter what, I may as well do something fun, you know? 	V0.07 	A small overworld room has been built, it's not as decorated as I'd like it, but that should come SOONISH. I want this to feel like it was actually taken from a full game, even though it isn't. For now it's just an empty room where you as Jonathan can talk to (and then fight) Dio. Give it a shot! 	Next update: Probably a pause menu. 	V0.05 	Added ACT and MERCY menu functionality, the bad news is I couldn't think of a way to defeat Dio in a pacifist run, so MERCY is pretty much just for fun, there is SOMETHING to do in the ACT menu though…  	V0.04 	Dio can now die.

Check out the Steam page here:  http://store.steampowered.com/app/595100   Evil Has Awakened   It is the 24th century, and mankind has only recently begun expanding its reach to the star systems nearest our own Solar System.  A dark and terrible secret is buried within a misshapen moon nestled in the massive asteroid belt of the Epsilon Eridani system. Pythos colony was built there ostensibly to exploit the planetoid's mineral resources, but now they've disturbed a kind of evil that lurks beyond the fringes of our comprehension.  Through an ever-changing labyrinth, you will remold yourself into a cybernetic killing machine using the powerful technologies of a long-dead alien civilization. With these new-found weapons, you will pave a path of aberrant corpses toward the greatest threat to mankind ever encountered.  CTHON is an old school science-fiction first-person shooter, where you become a cybernetic weapon against the dark legions of a powerful evil entity - known only as Cthon - who lurks within the planetoid. It is a classic space horror game, inspired by the likes of Doom, System Shock, and Quake.   Features  Fight - and die - through nine sprawling randomly generated levels. No two games are ever the same, and permanent death ensures unrelenting tension. Modify yourself with the cybernetic technologies of the ancients. A unique upgrade-powering system allows you to get down to the details of character building, and choose the stats you want, when you want, with millions of permutations. Mod types include defensive upgrades that can increase your physical strengths and offensive upgrades to maximize your firepower and grant new ways to exterminate your adversaries. Slay an extensive array of monstrous creatures, each with intriguing tactical strengths and weaknesses. Battle corrupted humanoids, alien abominations, and biomechanical constructs as you delve ever deeper. Use nano-tech currency to gain a strategic edge - access machines that can forge new items, replenish your resources, and expand your cybernetic framework. Secret areas abound in the labyrinth; scour the levels for them and reap the rewards - and dangers - they may hold. Choose one of three characters, each of them specialized toward different cybernetic builds. Multiple difficulty levels allow you to adjust the nightmare world to your tastes.

It has a similar rich aesthetic. A surreal, haunting feel. A sense that there’s more hidden below the surface. [...] The interface matches the ambition of the prose. The music is atmospheric and appropriate. The aesthetics of the design are completely aligned to the game experience.  It’s something a little bit special, this.""  —  McT's Interactive Fiction Reviews  ""Together with the glowing hypertext links and the echoing chants of the background music, the whole package is a hauntingly beautiful piece [...] As a breakfast, I think it's rice congee with a firm, white fish, topped with flakes of crispy fried onions and fresh chives. It has an ascetic look, but threads of ginger and sesame oil boiled in with the rice make it surprisingly flavourful. And then, piping hot green tea.""   — Christopher Huang,  The Breakfast Review  "" There is a gloom to the writing, yet an incredible sense of imaginary worlds constructing themselves around you. The language and style swaddles you in the meaning and life of this cult, accepting its reality and carrying you along with it.""   — Joel Couture,  Indie Games Plus ""The pensive mood of the game supports its plot. The author handles the alien details of the world well, showing rather than telling and focusing on the story rather than belaboring the setting details. It’s a much more original setting and plot than most games have, and the author provides just enough details to make it comprehensible but still mysterious, befitting the priest’s uncertainty about his gods.""    —  IFComprehensive  IFDB",Interactive Fiction,Dark Fantasy||Fantasy||ifcomp||interactive-fiction-competition||mythology||Narrative||ritual||Text based||Twine||weird-fiction,DEVOTIONALIA,grimoirtua.itch.io/devotionalia
"You have learned to accept the agonies of the Sympathy. The Aralunate crawls like a powerful hand, and when its towering fingers are snapped or twisted in a sortie, you feel it in your limbs: the gunshot pop of a broken leg, the crushing pressure that jerks your arm away from the control panel and bends it backwards.

"Project Wheels is driving game that strides to be different from the rest of the genre. Why is it different? The game is different from others as it features: A really nice physics system, to smash all you want! A semi realistic vehicle physics system, for a fun enjoyable time A low poly palette for good performance, and great looks on lower end PC's Makes the most of the beautiful Material Design Design Project Wheels uses a low poly design, for beautiful, easy to build, and performance friendly vehicles and open world map The game also uses Google's Material Design for the UI and other elements. Material Design fit this game the best, as it was visually pleasing, and it matched the style of gameplay I was trying to achieve with Project Wheels. Gameplay Project Wheels is based around having the freedom to explore, build, and customize the world you play in, and how you enjoy the game in your own personal way.  It will also feature things such as a level editor, and hopefully a vehicle customizer in the future for an even more personalised experience! Well, why should I buy it? Project Wheels is going to slowly become a community fed game, with custom vehicle and map creation, with the ability to share, use, and create assets than can be used in the community. All that coming in the future! The money will also help pay for: Contracting 3D artists to build new things for the game Get a proper website set up Setting up a community forum for users to share maps, features, glitches, etc. For any questions, comments, or business inquires please contact tri3studios@gmail.com Also, please feel free to pay the $5!

"All Our Asias is a surreal, lo-fi, 3D adventure, about identity, race, and nationality.   It received an Honorable Mention for the Nuovo category in the 2019 IGF awards! (Please note that a tweet said there is a new edition of the game, there is not.) (Buy the Fan Pack for $4.99! You get an OST + a 150+ page artbook, which contains art from the game, commentary on the game's visuals, level design, soundtrack, narrative and more.) All Our Asias is a  free game  by  Sean Han Tani , co-creator of Anodyne and Even the Ocean. Join the newsletter  here .  You can also  play this game on Steam.   All Our Asias is a surreal, lo-fi, 3D adventure, about identity, race, and nationality.    The protagonist's name is Yuito.  31, Japanese-American. Hedge fund analyst. USA-born and raised.  One day he receives a letter from his estranged father. His father is dying. It's too late for Yuito to speak to him.   But his father is on life support, and Yuito has an opportunity. He can undergo a Memory World Visitation, and enter his father's Memory World, a series of supernatural landscapes where Yuito can explore his father's experiences and secrets.  It is risky, but the idea of meeting his father, and perhaps something more, compels Yuito to make the journey...  The people and places Yuito encounters along the way - these will be the story of the game.  2-3 hours long. Navigate surreal and ''realistic'' areas via simple 3rd-person movement and light platforming. Easy to play. Converse with characters small and large as Yuito progresses deeper into this Memory World. A lo-fi art direction influenced by the PSX and N64 era. A soundtrack by Sean ""seagaia"" Han Tani, and talented collaborators.  From Sean Han Tani, the co-creator of  Anodyne  and  Even the Ocean . Enjoy some screenshots of ""Sean Han Tani Game Design Works Volume 1: All Our Asias"". Note: this game is only supported for Windows Vista+, OSX 10.11+, and recent and popular versions of linux (SteamOS, Ubuntu).

Yussef Cole, Unwinnable:  ""Surrounded by Strangers"" ""Playing All Our Asias, I can’t help picturing how my own journey through my mother’s memories might go; how it might have been to experience New York in the 60’s, as an immigrant with only a few words of English at her disposal.""   Amr Al-Aaser,  All Our Asias is a PSX-style adventure that shows the beauty of lo-fi graphics (Video)   Danielle Riendeau, Waypoint,  A Game That Uses PS1 Visuals to Tell a Story About Asian American Identity ""The result is a game that feels very specific, and in that specificity and honesty, feels universal. Much of this is also carried by the art style—low poly worlds and abstract character art that feels deeply evocative, at once preserving the warmth of the pixel art that dominated Han Tani’s earlier games, and adding the sense of freedom and size that 3D navigation can bring to the table.""   Sanud, Videodame,  Playing an Asian American as a Westernised Asian in All Our Asias  Seeing how Yuito feebly holds onto that loose connection between him and the Korean restaurant owner seems like the reality of most Asian Americans, but in Asia, the label of “Asian” becomes meaningless because of other minute differences, and the General is quick to point that out. Perhaps, beyond holding onto a label that applies to a giant continent, it’s better if there are ways to bridge the gap so that both communities of Asians and Asian Americans can understand each other. Sophia Park, Third Person,  Memory, culture, and the limits of artifice With this in mind, the self-described, lo-fi “Playstation 1” graphics of the game are an intentional limitation: they refract the world; they self-consciously represent another world. The graphic limitation is a symptom of the game’s artifice; the graphic limitation makes us — and Yuito — see it as just a game. But the artifice isn’t play, it’s experiences. It’s a life. And it can’t just be pilfered for an answer on our terms. And so, what do you do instead?  Well, you just have to listen. Kelley Dong, The Village Voice,  “Annihilation” and Alex Garland’s Wrestlings With Asian Bodies ""However limited, Garland’s scientific inclinations have led Annihilation into the long-contested debate of what constitutes an Asian body, an Asian identity — a line of inquiry that echoes the silhouetted mannequin of the composer and developer Sean Han Tani’s 2017 game, All Our Asias, who asks, 'You and your relatives might be from Asia. [But] does it mean anything…to say you do Asian things, or to say you support Asian causes?' "" Julie Muncy, Wired,  'All Our Asias' Is A Vital Reminder That Creators Matter ""It's not autobiographical, but it asks questions that seem personally essential to the author, and gives Yukio's strange, meditative journey a quiet insistence. What connects us, really? What does Yukio have in common with a father he never knew? What do I have in common with people of my race, or class?""

"This game is in early development, only the prototype is available.  Black Feather Forest is a 2D adventure game inspired by true events and Haida mythology, as well as things like True Detective, Fargo, Bright Falls, Kentucky Route Zero, Puzzle Agent and Detective Grimoire.  You play as Sofia, a documentary maker, and together with your cameraman Caleb you travel to the town of Augier's Peak, up in the wilderness of rural Canada, where three people have gone missing recently.  You are free to travel around town, where you will meet a handful of inhabitants that all have their own reasons to help you discover what happened - or not. You gather clues by talking to people and combining pieces of evidence and statements to slowly try to figure out who or what is behind all this. Install instructions Important note for MacOS users:  MacOS by default does not allow applications from 'unidentified developers' to run. This basically means I would have to get a $99 license just to get my apps to open. Instead, you can follow  this guide  from Apple to learn how to open apps you've downloaded from the internet.

"In  Reconquista  you play as an Incan rebel coming to reclaim a sacred artifact from the conquistador-occupied island of Huaca, off the coast of South America.  Reconquista  is a short narrative first-person exploration game. It is the first 3D game I've made, and I have relied heavily on the Unity Asset Store to augment my lackluster 3D modelling skills. A list of all the assets I used is available in the game's pause menu.  The title is actually a play on the existing name of a medieval period where the Spanish reclaimed land that was taken from them by invaders. This was long before they themselves set sail for South America as the well-known Conquistadors, so I liked the irony of the fact that in this game you have to steal something BACK from the conquistadors. Hence, literally,  RE-conquista .  And Huaca is an Incan term for some kind of sacred object or monument, as well as the term for spirits in a state of being after death.  Changelog:   v2.2  Made the UI compatible with gamepads! Now you won't need a keyboard or mouse around to play the game. Added soft shadows for dynamics lightsources (so no more jaggies). Tweaks to mouse smoothing, lighting, color grading and other visual effects. Many small performance improvements.  v2.1  Replaced the lame ending screens with something better for when you complete the game (or die), and greatly increased the time period before the game quits (or restarts) automatically once you get there Lowered default mouse sensitivity Added a mouse sensitivity slider to the pause menu Added a windowed mode toggle to the pause menu in the Windows version (MacOS version already supports multitasking) Reduced the amount of conquistador spawn points Made the Fear effect less intrusive Replaced the artefact's pedestal with a better model Improved the motion blur quality Enabled soft shadows on the highest quality level Fixed a bug that prevented the Quality slider from actually adjusting some things correctly (mainly shadow and texture resolution) Fixed a bug in the UI when interacting with the resolution dropdown Fixed the normal map on the stone tiles texture  v2.0  Gamepad support. Increased size of the player to feel better-proportioned to the island. Completely overhauled foliage and rocks. New buildings hidden across the island. Added 'puzzle' to get access to pyramid. Added extra detail to pyramid. Replaced artefact with a better model. Added rain to late game. New enemy texture and animations. Enemy now attacks at close range instead of insta-killing you. Improved terrain rendering (normal maps, no more stretched textures). New postprocessing effects (depth of field, motion blur, tonemapping, color grading, anti-aliasing). Improved fire effect. Added in-game resolution selection option. Improved default mouse smoothing. Improved UI look and layout. Proper occlusion culling. Performance tweaks and bug fixes.  v1.1  Added a checkbox in the pause menu to disable mouse smoothing. Fixed the default graphics setting not matching with the in-game graphics quality setting. This might improve performance as the in-game setting toggles additional things like draw distance and foliage density.",Adventure,conquistadors||Exploration||Historical||Horror||inca||island||Narrative||night||scary||temple,Reconquista,hedgefield.itch.io/reconquista
"Helena of Achaea is said to be the most beautiful woman in the galaxy.  After her elopement with the neighboring Wilusan princess, Achaea declares war on Wilusa resulting in a years-long bloody conflict. As the war is drawing to a close, Helena is escorted back to her rightful place in Achaea. However, something goes wrong and their ship crash lands on a desolate tiny planet, killing everyone on board except for Helena and a single soldier.   Now stranded in the vastness of space with only a strange soldier for company, Helena finds herself thinking about what sort of fate awaits her. And more importantly, does she even have a place to return to?  Loosely based on a futuristic all-female version of Homer's  The Iliad , Helena's Flowers is a visual novel that explores the ideas of beauty and self-image.

Play through 9 missions against the AI in the mission mode, and battle against local friends or the AI on one of 29 symmetrical versus maps. Or, design your own maps with the map editor!  # Installation Download the 'Terra.zip' file and extract it. Run the 'launcher.exe' file to play!  You may need to download and install the Microsoft Visual C++ redistributable, if you don't already have it (many other games include it): -  https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555  # How to Play Your goal is to be the last corporation standing! Eliminate the enemy HQ! Turns in Terra are executed simultaneously. This means that each player will simultaneously give secret orders to each of their units, and then those orders will be played out at the same time. If two units occupy the same tile, they'll fight!  Once you've issued orders to all of your units, open the pause menu and 'submit' your turn to continue!  You'll need to expand your base, harvest resources, build new buildings, research upgrades, and raise an army to defeat your opponent. Units have strengths and weaknesses, so a balanced composition of units is recommended (unless you're very confident that your enemy is specializing in one type or another!)  Generally, you can press TAB / Middle Click on a unit, building, or upgrade to view more details about it.  There are multiple units and buildings: * HQ: Your base! Can produce Colonists and research economic upgrades. If destroyed, you lose! * Generators: Harvests resources from crystal tiles each turn. * Barracks: Can produce combat units, and research upgrades for them. * Tech Labs: Can research any type of upgrade, and is the only building that can research new types of units. Slightly heals allies. * Towers: A defensive structure. Damages nearby enemies each turn, and has a weak melee attack.   * Colonists: Your basic economic worker unit. Can build buildings, and are the main way you can gather more resources. * Troopers: A bread-and-butter ground combat unit. Strong against buildings and mobility units, but notably weak to ranged attacks. * Rangers: A basic ranged unit, it can target a distant tile to attack without counterattack. Weak to high mobility units, their ranged attack can be contested and canceled by occupying their tile. * Ghosts: A high-mobility glass cannon unit, who can move through enemy units to get at the back line.  Strong against Colonists and ranged units, but easily defeated by most ground forces.  * Guardians: A tier-2 ground combat unit. A strong defender, Guardians provide defense bonuses to allies. Notably vulnerable when they're caught on the move. * Boltcasters: A tier-2 ranged unit, with an impressive attack range. Their attacks deal some damage to tiles around their target, as well. Notably low movement. * Banshees: A tier-2 mobility unit, with extremely high movement range. They can pass through normally untraversable terrain, and through enemy lines. Notably low health.  ## Controls Menus & Battles: * Left click / ENTER: Make selections, confirm * Right click / SHIFT: Cancel selections, back out of menus * Middle click / TAB: Open contextual menus, like showing order previews, or seeing help about menu options * ESCAPE: Open the pause menu, back out of menus  Level Editor: * Left click / ENTER: Place terrain / pieces * Right click / SHIFT: Place the secondary terrain type / Remove pieces * Mouse wheel / PGUP / PGDOWN: Scroll currently placed terrain or piece type * CTRL + Mouse wheel / PGUP / PGDOWN: Scroll the secondary terrain type / change piece teams * TAB: Switch between placing terrain and pieces * ESCAPE: Open the pause menu",Strategy,Board Game||Turn-based Strategy,Terra,ianplu.itch.io/terra

Based on a  creepypasta , the Backrooms brings a nostalgic feeling of being lost in endless piles of empty rooms with fluorescent lights at full hum-buzz.

""If you're not careful and you noclip out of reality in the wrong areas, you'll end up in the Backrooms, where it's nothing but the stink of old moist carpet, the madness of mono-yellow, the endless background noise of fluorescent lights at maximum hum-buzz, and approximately six hundred million square miles of randomly segmented empty rooms to be trapped in.

"Our work in progress, Pre-Alpha, referred to as Creative is a proof of concept tech demo which is equipped with the tools to experience building and multiplayer in a single biome. It has limited features but represents the progress we’ve made and how the game looks and feels. We will continue to update it free of charge as we develop the paid Alpha.  Outworlder is the maiden project of Igloosoft Games, a newly founded indie game company consisting of experienced developers primarily residing in the Eastern US. It will be released on Windows, Mac and Linux.  Main features:  Fluid, gun focused combat Emphasis on colonising and community building Complex NPC based crafting Comprehensively designed ecosystems Sophisticated and realistic terrain generation Craftable doors to z-planes Designed to be easily accessible for modders  Outworlder is an open-world sandbox adventure that will follow the player on their journey from a lone survivor of a shipwreck to being the leader and protector of a burgeoning spacefaring colony. You will begin on a cold, hazardous world, and will quickly have to navigate the various elements and dangers of a hostile alien environment while learning to farm crops, tame wildlife and keep livestock as you find the survivors needed in order to eventually launch your adventure into space. There will be minimal narrative – instead, there will be a sprawling setting to explore and piece together at your leisure.   Tailor the game to your own needs  At Igloosoft Games, we recognise that certain parts of games aren’t for everyone, so we strive to make Outworlder a customisable experience that can be tailored to any player’s given needs. Want to just build things and avoid combat? Turn it off! Want more of a challenge? Increase the rate and strength of attackers. Want to just shoot things? Try the many spinoff multiplayer modes we have planned such as Capture the Flag, Deathmatch and Survival Challenge modes. Outworlder has also been designed to be accessible to modders, so players can further customise the experience.  Building opportunities  Building has been fleshed out with many quality of life features to aid the process, as well as some features never tried before in games. We’re particularly proud of the addition of craftable Z-doors – you’ll now be able to place and build RPG-style compartmentalised rooms within your buildings. No more having to walk through people’s living rooms to reach the other side of a house!   The Colony  Your main objective in Outworlder is to build and maintain a colony that can survive against the harshness and coldness of life in deep space. You will cross many obstacles on your journey, not least frequent raids from pirates and raiders, as well as some encounters of the otherworldly type. To support a community, evolve and gain access to facilities and infrastructures. Construct power grids and a food supply, while appropriating defenses to deter the attention your fledgling community will no doubt generate.   Help your colonists help you  Unlike other games of the genre, the player will need to rely on other survivors to build all but the most rudimentary of items and objects. You’ll expand your base by attracting survivors – some will come naturally, some will need rescuing, and some can even be captured and turned to your side.  NPCs will each come with their own pool of items they can construct, and eventually you will need to have a functioning network of NPCs to build advanced items.  We will have all kinds of survivors that can be found. Including such professions as gunsmiths, doctors, cooks, radio operators, administrators and engineers. There’ll also be less useful ones like used car salesmen and video game reviewers that you’ll have to find a use for in your bases.  Naturally, these NPCs will need to be protected and each have their own requirements and needs.  Thoughtful World Generation  In Outworlder, we understand that making a world feel alien isn’t as simple as making it multicolored and throwing some stitched together monsters in. That’s why we’ve gone to great lengths to develop a sophisticated world generation system that seeds believable worlds with distinguishable land features, thoughtful color palettes, compelling cave systems and uniquely designed wildlife and ecosystems. Some of these worlds will call for a change in gameplay style – certain worlds such as desert planets and radioactive worlds will call for special gear in order to survive, but the rewards for the additional risk are great.  The majority of creatures, plants and wildlife are individually designed with carefully defined behaviors to provide a deeper game experience. Creatures interact with each other, react differently to the players, and exist within their own ecosystem which can be exploited by the player. It’s truly a living, breathing world to explore.     Explore the stars  In the full game, players will be able to commandeer ships and bring their colonies to other worlds. Naturally, space is a big place and there’s more than just planets out there. Players will be able to visit space stations, moons and explore the wrecks of long -abandoned starships. To facilitate this, there will be a wide range of ships of varied layouts and classes available to buy and sell, complete with their own facilities such as orbital weapons, hangars and medical bays.   Open development plan  Transparency and maintaining good relations with our community is important to us at Igloosoft Games, so we will be developing the game using a modular approach in order to simplify development and avoid doing everything at once. This allows us to release playable milestones for those who pre-order the game and want to see its progress. We feel this is the best compromise between transparency and giving buyers something to play early if they desire.  Pre-ordering will grant access to the pre-alpha version of the game and all of its updates. The pre-alpha will evolve into the full game described, but at first will take place on a single world in order for us to focus on the primary gameplay mechanics, before expanding to other world types and eventually allowing travel as the game develops. On release, everyone who pre-ordered the game will receive a copy of the full game.   Join our Discord server  We welcome and foster an active community, please come see us at our discord channel where we are most likely to see any of your questions or suggestions (or just come say hi!)

"Hana , the protagonist of Asagao Academy, transfers to the school after a series of negative experiences. She desperately wants to join the Normal Boots Club, though her motives may be less than pure. Shy, awkward, quiet, and a wee bit insecure, she has a big heart and genuinely cares about people.  	   	 	   	 Mai  is Hana's loud, boisterous, and spunky roommate. She's obsessed with the Normal Boots Club, Jared in particular, and is a bit blunt. Her excessive energy makes her an ace on the school's volleyball team.  	   	   	 Jon  is one of the founding members of the Normal Boots Club and the head of the Drama Club. He adores bizarre retro games, and loves his pet bird, Jacques, more than life itself. Jon is charismatic, energetic, and animated. Everything seems to be going well for him - that is, until he loses something dear...  	 	   	 PBG ,  one of the founding members of the Normal Boots Club, is an easy-going, caring, and optimistic guy. He doesn't bother with school, instead focusing on important things like soccer and pinball. Despite his friendliness, he's giving Hana strange looks, and then starts skipping class...  	   	 Jared   is a part-time model. Naturally, he is the most attractive person in school and knows it, often coming off as vain, fickle, and shallow. Despite this, Jared truly cares for his friends, and the confidence he projects may not be as solid as it appears.  	 	   	 Satch  is an assistant librarian at the school library working on a virtual reality machine. Satch is intellectual, empathetic, mature and well-read. He always thinks of others' feelings before his own, but keeps his problems to himself - which might backfire when Normal Boots is targeted...  	 	   	 Shane  is a foreign exchange student from England. Quiet, straightforward, and blunt, he's a natural with trivia competitions, but instead chooses to challenge himself with Nario Cart. Despite how much the club needs Hana's skills, he is steadfastly against her joining.  	 	   	 Jirard  is an avid collector of Itty Bitty Kitty figurines. Passionate, ambitious, and a bit of a perfectionist, he is the resident speed-runner. Perhaps as a result of his need to complete, he does well both academically and socially, being one of the most caring people on campus.  	   	 	 Paul, Nick, and Josh  are blood bound under Continue?'s banner. They are inseparable and typically found wreaking general havoc by reenacting the '80s and '90s arcade beat-em-ups they love so dearly. Paul is running for student council president, but when a strong rival appears, will the pressure of competition be too much?

"Virtual Towers Online (VTO) is a realistic, ""to-scale"" exact replica of the Alton Towers theme park. It is designed to be as close to realism as possible using architectual plans and thousands of photo references. The end goal is to have a multi player environment where users from all over the world can digitally interact with each other throughout the entire park.    What's more is that it is designed to have a freeroam mode and and a career mode where users can actually take roles within the park such as physically controlling rides using the ride control panels as a ride operater.  The game will be VR compatible and offer a unique, never done before experience.  Please visit Facebook.com/virtualtowersonline for more information   Please note the current version of the game was released in 2018 and so progress has moved on massively since then.

"Berlin, November 2089:  The Cold War never ended. For 150 years both sides have used time manipulation technology to observe and counter each other’s every move. Now this fragile state of affairs is approaching a breaking point, as a rogue nuclear strike will send the world into turmoil. Both sides have scrambled to send agents back in time to find who is behind the attack and how to prevent it. If they fail, the whole world will turn to ash, forever.  “All Walls Must Fall’s nightclub shoot-outs are a devilish dream, capturing at once the brilliance of Terminator’s Tech Noir horror and the actual punk in cyberpunk.” Rock Paper Shotgun “Witty and wonderfully scrappy, turn-based combat has never looked quite like this before.” Eurogamer  -  Recommended “My favorite part of the game is watching the brutal, complex routines I’ve been painstakingly scripting play out before me on the bustling dance floors of a cyberpunk, neon-noir vision of Berlin.” Strategy Gamer   -  4 / 5  All Walls Must Fall is an isometric tactics game where actions happen to the pulsing beat of the music. You control time travelling secret agents as they jump and loop through a single night in the city of Berlin. Using a pausable real-time system, carefully plan your decisions and use powerful time manipulation abilities to your advantage, as you carry out your mission in the shadows or in plain sight. Levels are procedurally recombined, giving All Walls Must Fall a highly replayable campaign structure, while still offering individually crafted components and set-pieces.  All Walls Must Fall takes inspiration from genre classics like  X-Com ,  Syndicate  and  REZ , as well more recent indie games like  The Banner Saga ,  Braid ,  SUPERHOT  and  Crypt of the Necrodancer .  Isometric action-tactics game for Windows, Mac and Linux Hybrid real-time / simultaneous turn-based tactical gameplay Procedurally generated levels and campaign that plays different every time Sci-Fi noir Berlin as a divided city in which the Cold War never ended Mind-bending time manipulation abilities that allow you to experiment with possible futures and rewind to the past.

"TORB is the ultimate game of  physics-based swordplay!  Like a puppet, the character's every move is tied to springs, joints and wheels that you trigger in simple, familiar ways to produce  true free-form combat . Blades clash, slide and behave like real world physical objects!  There are no character animations in TORB.  The fight is happening immediately in a virtual, but physically-grounded world. Each fight, each swing, each individual collision is completely unique and can always surprise you!  MASTER THE CRYSTAL BLADE! MASTER THE TORB!  FEATURES:  -  TRUE FREE-FORM COMBAT  - Create your own techniques, styles and moves. Unique control system allows for first-time TORBers to jump in and  have fun while giving cagey, battle-tested masters endless depth and possibilities.  -  VERSUS -  UP TO 4 PLAYER LOCAL MULTIPLAYER (Teams or free-for-all) - Dynamic, lightning-fast chess matches where opponents must react to each each other in split second real-time.  Players look for actual, exploitable openings that dynamically emerge and then strike with zen-like immediacy. Great duels and team battles build to a fever pitch, and only mastery can determine the outcome!  -  WAVES -  UP TO 4 PLAYER CO-OP or SINGLE PLAYER - Face an ever-spawning Gorblyn army on 3 completely different stages, each with unique phsyical structures for you to use to your advantage.   Only razor wits and sharp teamwork can save you from the onslaught!  -  SANDBOX - UP TO 4 PLAYER CO-OP or SINGLE PLAYER - With your mouse, create your own combat scenarios. Place dummies to test moves, create meditative exercises against AI, or stage ENORMOUS, GAME CRASHING BATTLES!     NOTES:  IMPORTANT NOTE!  TORB is best played with a controller! It works with mouse/keyboard, but it has been designed for analog stick/trigger controllers.  OPTIONS MENU :  - Hide UI  - Control Rumble Strength - Xbox One controllers are much newer than our game's engine version, so they behave a bit strangely. In particular, some have unusually strong rumble in TORB. Lower this value if it's too nuts.  - Music Volume - Did you know our music is dynamic? As AI enemies spawn, their theme mixes fluidly with the other enemies' themes, forming a SYMPHONY OF DEATH.  - Gravity Scale - This can get nuts, but go for it.  - Shield Recharge Time - Turning this down really changes the game.  - Total Bops to win Free For All - Changes the target number of bops needed to win a TORBmatch when its every TORB for itself.  - Total Bops to win Free For All - Changes the target number of bops needed to win a TORBmatch when its TeamTORBs time. There I said it.  KNOWN ISSUES:  - KNOWN UNKNOWNS - TORB is an old project with lots of experimenting and tinkering under its hood. When you make a game about a crystal dimension of infinite, unique sword battles, you pay for it with some mysteries.  To be honest, we don't really know all the crazy stuff that can happen in TORB. Its never lived out in the wild, so be prepared for some unpredictable things. Its a weird little game, but it loves to be played and its can always surprise you!  - STARTUP - Its so weird how it takes so long to get to that unity splash screen. Sorry.  - WEAPONS - The game is currently balanced for the main weapon, the CRYSTAL BLADE! However, you can try out some alternate weapons in any game mode. THESE WEAPONS ARE NOT AT ALL BALANCED AGAINST EACH OTHER.   - WAVES (THE BRIDGE) - That map is big, but it was made in less than a month, so sometimes enemies get stuck in strange crevasses! This is lousy because then you can't end the wave and you have to restart. Sorry, it bothers us too.  - WAVES (THE BRIDGE)- Sometimes a buddy gets stuck on a wall. If you've played waves, YOU'LL KNOW WHO WE MEAN. Use your grapple to un-stick them.  - WAVES (THE BRIDGE) (sigh) - Sometimes the gates are a bit hard to open. They are completely physical contraptions so they can be a bit unpredictable.  -WAVES (DOOM DONUT) - Some slowdown due to insasne physics goign on.  CREDITS  TORB created by Adrian Lopez-Mobilia and Jason Rosenstock  Music by Gabe Lopez-Mobilia  Massive 'THANK YOU' to everyone who  encouraged us to keep working on TORB.

"What's the game about?  In this game, you play as Fungy, whose plant friends are dying due to climate change. Your goal is to go around and convince the residents of Zoozoo City to team up with you against Govcorp and take measures to stop climate change! You will enter dialogue-based combat and use rhetorical strategies to convince these characters to join your team!  The game is filled with caricatures of contemporary characters, such as:  An Instagram Influencer ( who you can follow on Instagram by the way ) A Climate Change Denier who (rightfully) believes that he lives in a simulation A hippie, a politician, a businesswoman, etc!  Each of these characters' personalities allow for fun witty dialogue and cultural references that easily resonate with contemporary audiences!  In addition, this game ends up providing players with information about climate change in a way that is completely embedded, and does not overwhelm the player as an ""education game."" An increasingly hot topic, we believe that Fungy is at the forefront of culture.  Sounds cool! The project  is  was paused?  Oh, Itch.io user, I'm glad you asked! The version that we have currently released is only a fraction of the final vision we have for Fungy. We would like add an entire prequel where you are playing a normal cute RPG with Fungy's plant friends with classic quests like deliver this message, bring me some food, etc.. All of a sudden, they start dying and the game takes a very different turn.  Currently, the dialogue-based combat is linear, but we would actually like to expand on this and create a combat-system that makes the game more engaging and challenging.  Finally, there are many characters that we would like to add.  We only had a month to make this game, so we had to say no to a lot of these decisions, unfortunately. But, we believe that Fungy can be much more with the help of an audience who cares and wants to see more of what we can give. We are not asking for much, simply a rating and a comment will help us so that we can prove interest enough to start a Kickstarter in the future!

"The FREE playable proof-of-concept demo from Jimmy Vegas. Developed in Unity.  What is The Demons Inside?  The Demons Inside is a proof-of-concept demo based around a semi-survival horror game. It is 100% playable and FREE for anybody who wishes to play, lasting around 30 - 60 minutes.  Why was The Demons Inside made?  The idea behind creating The Demons Inside is to show that something cool can be designed, built and coded in just 12 weeks:  1. Spending only 1 - 3 hours a day.   2. By just one person.   3. In a short amount of time.   4. By using knowledge ONLY learned from my YouTube channel.   5. Without spending a penny.   Yep, that's right, you could build anything and everything you want, on your own for free just from following the tutorials on my channel and with only free assets.  What PC Specifications do I need?  You'll need at least: CPU:  Intel i5 1.8 Ghz or equivalent RAM:  4GB or better OS:  Windows 7 / 8 / 10 or equivalent VIDEO CARD:  NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960 or better or equivalent FREE DISK SPACE:  1.2 GB  What happens in the demo?  The demo takes place at the beginning of chapter 2 while you're searching for your partner. I wanted to go a little bit cliche with it because I kind of like that sort of thing. You'll see inspiration from several games too. There are puzzle and item elements as well as small randomization elements. You also have choices to make at certain parts of the demo.  Anything else to know?  If something cool can be made in a short time, just imagine what a team can do in a longer period of time. Bugs & glitches will be present, but no game-breaking bugs should exist in the demo.",Survival||Puzzle,FPS||Horror||jimmy-vegas||Mystery||Survival Horror||tutorial||Unity,The Demons Inside,jimmyvegas.itch.io/the-demons-inside
"Demo out now! Watch the trailer on YouTube:     After a heated argument with her Father, a desperate Bay Dawes runs to the woods and digs up a box of her Mother's belongings.  These few but precious items she gathered before her Mother went to Witherington End Asylum are all she has left of her. Within the box, there is also an ornate bottle full of a strange dark liquid with a faded but inviting label promising to transform her into her most perfect self.   But this is a dangerous concoction that never should have been brewed by her alchemist Mother, let alone fall into the hands of her only child.   Wiping away her tears, Dawes lifts the bottle out of the box and without a second thought, she drinks the potion. Seconds later, her balance falters and drops the bottle. As the few remaining drops drip into the soil, she stumbles to the ground, her eyes facing the now empty bottle.   As she begins to lose consciousness, her attention is briefly caught by blurry small print on the label before she closes her eyes      Warning: Can cause memory loss, paranoia, hallucinations, insanity and death.      Dawes slowly regains consciousness as sounds of birdsong, and the unhealthy groan of her computer fill her ears. This provides her with some comfort and confirmation that she is back in her bedroom. Glancing over to her monitor, Dawes notices she's received an email. Getting up slowly and while still unsteady on her feet, she walks over to the computer to further inspect the note. The mysterious email from an unknown sender warns her to leave home as she's being accused of murdering a missing boy, and they're coming for her... Whoever 'they' are...    Prank or not, the problem is, Dawes can't remember what she did over the last 24 hours. To find out what happened, she might need to have conversations with inanimate objects to help her remember.

Ancient Warfare 	    	Ancient Warfare is a minimalistic low poly ancient war game for Ludumdare 36 ""Ancient Technology"".  	You take control of a knight with sword and shield and try to kill all the red guys.   	The game features 3 different game modes:  	 Campaign   	10 Levels to have some fun and kill red guys  	 Endless   	3 different difficulty settings. Enemies spawn faster with the time and you have to kill as many as possible.  	 Custom Battle   	You can place the enemies like you want and try to beat them.   	There are currently 7 different enemy types in game:  	 Sword fighter   	A simple guy with a normal blade, medium dangerous.  	 Mace fighter   	 This guy will try to kill you with a mace, in groups and behind you, they are very dangerous   	 Spear fighter   	 Tries to stay at range from the player, because his spear is long enough to hit him from away. This makes this troop quite difficult to handle.   	 Archer   	 As the name says, this guy has a bow and will try to sniper you from far distance. Better use your shield to protect from flying arrows.   	 Unarmed   	 This guy doesn't have any weapons and will just try to punch you. Large groups can make you lose the control.   	 Knight   	 This guy is like the player. He is equipped with a sword and a shield and has more hit points than the other units.

"At first glance, the game's cutesy, cartoony graphics and simplistic interface give the impression that this is a juvenile game designed for small children. However, it soon becomes apparent that the game is in fact a deeply political, philosophical, and even academic narrative that defies easy description. It is to adventure games what Umberto Eco's Il nome della rosa is to murder mystery novels. –  Adventure Classic Gaming For those looking for an adventure with a sense of wonder, The Sea Will Claim Everything is a must-have. –  Adventure Gamers It's like a five year old with a degree in comparative literature. –  Scripted Sequence The Fortunate Isles are in trouble! The sinister Lord Urizen is using the economic crisis to impose his cruel policies on the people, and all the local politicians seem to be in his thrall. Meanwhile, the ancient biotechnological dwelling known as Underhome is facing foreclosure, and its inhabitants don't even know why. Desperate for help, The Mysterious-Druid, scion of the Mysterious-Druid family and caretaker of Underhome, creates a magical portal that will allow you to interact directly with the Lands of Dream. Are you ready for a journey? The Portal The portal is easy to use - it functions much like a classic point & click adventure game. You can move around the world using specially-grown directional arrows, store objects in your surprisingly capacious inventory, talk to the inhabitants of the Fortunate Isles using a technodruidic Wall of Text biointerface, and spend most of your time examining mushrooms. The Itchy Version Time in the Lands of Dream flows at a different pace, so it doesn't really matter that this portal was initially released in 2012. It has since been updated with a number of oft-requested features and improvements, as well as a number of strange additions and changes no-one asked for, but which have appeared anyway. Technodruidism is frequently unpredictable. The Itchy Version is completely DRM-free, but otherwise just like the version on Steam.  And you also a get a Steam key. Feature List Explore the Fortunate Isles!  Talk to interesting people and creatures!  A mouse in your inventory!  Walls of text!  Thousands upon thousands of details to find!  An awesome alchemy system that's totally not confusing!  Contains no achievements!  Includes ""The Road to Underhome"" PDF!  No need to be into adventure games to enjoy this!  But it's cool if you are!  Literary, thoughtful, philosophical!  Quirky, interesting, different!!  Something, something, something!  Adjectives! Words! SEO-optimized flatulence!  You know what? Feature lists suck!  Better just read a few of the reviews!  Or try another portal to the Lands of Dream! Most of them are free!  If I see any more exclamation marks, I'll get a headache! Credits The portal was created by The Mysterious-Druid with the help of Jonas Kyratzes ( The Talos Principle ,  Serious Sam 4 ,  The Infinite Ocean ), Verena Kyratzes ( Serious Sam 4 ,  Zombies and Elephants , the Lands of Dream series), and Chris Christodoulou ( Risk of Rain ,  Deadbolt ).

"NOTE : This demo is now fairly outdated. The game's mechanics have pretty drastically changed, and I would no longer say this demo is representative of what the final product will be. To see more up to date progress, feel free to  check out my twitter  where I post development videos regularly. Thanks!  —  In a world plagued by demonic spirits known as Ethers and Umbras, the  Arbiter  is the only person capable of defeating them.  You play as Ashe, a young boy (and the newly appointed Arbiter) whose job is to venture out and defeat the spirits that threaten humanity.  The Arbiter has the unique ability to  transform  between the spiritual Ether and Umbra powers, allowing him to fight back against the spirits that hunt him.  An Ether can only be defeated by an Umbra, and an Umbra only by an Ether. By constantly transforming, you can manipulate how these two powers interact to slay your enemies and complete your mission.   Kickstarter  I'm the sole developer for Arbiter and in addition to my own savings, I'm currently funding its development through  Kickstarter !  The game pretty much lives and dies by the Kickstarter's success, so please consider supporting it if you're interested!  SUPPORT ON KICKSTARTER   Demo  The demo is a polished, fully playable tutorial level that will most likely appear in the final game. It's about 15-20m long, filled with various enemy encounters and a boss at the end.  The game is currently only supported on  Windows (PC) .  I recommend playing with a controller since that was the tutorials are specified for. The game is still fully playable with keyboard and mouse, however, and you can see the control layout for those  here .

"NOTE: Read below on how to support the creators!  You can support Josh Powlison by using the ""Support this Kinetic Novel"" button above, but that money'll just go to him! Thank anyone you want by choosing that and/or the other creatives' links in the credits below!  Trigger Warning  Drug abuse and suicide  Are you new to Kinetic Novels?  What is a Kinetic Novel?  It's like an old-school video game cutscene. Kinetic Novels show pictures of characters along with text.  Usually, character images will change to express different emotions, music will play in the background, large images will cover the screen... the medium will throw quite a bit at you, but at its core it's character text with character images!  Present tense.  Most Kinetic Novels are told in the present tense: ""this is happening"" versus ""this was happening"".  First-person perspective.  Most Kinetic Novels are told from the perspective of the Main Character (MC). You don't usually see the MC in a Kinetic Novel, because we're seeing the story  through their eyes .  Some readers will imagine they're the MC as they read, although this isn't necessary- it's up to you and how you want to enjoy the story. I'll often read it as a narrative, not as if I'm actually the MC.  All narration is from the MC's perspective, and so may or may not be reliable.  Who's talking?  The name at the top of the textbox shows who's currently talking. If the name is ""Me"", the Main Character is talking (since the story's told from the first person).  If no character name is shown at the top of the textbox, the text is the MC's narration or thoughts.  How do you play it?  Click on the screen to go to the next line of text. If you're not sure if all text has been shown, you can wait for an arrow to show up at the bottom-right of the screen, signaling for you to continue.  If you click while text is still appearing, it'll display it all immediately, but you'll miss some of the animations and timing of the characters' tone.  In some cases, text may continue automatically, maybe to give the effect of a character being cut off in conversation or stopping themselves mid-thought.  What's the difference between a Kinetic Novel and a Visual Novel?  Kinetic Novels play the same way every time, whereas Visual Novels allow you to make choices within the story. You read that correctly. The terminology is weird, but it's what it is.  Controls  Hover near the top of the screen to access the menu.

Known Bugs  If any of these bugs are getting in the way of your experience, please let me  know!  Mouse wheel up resets music tracks. This is due to how Showpony fundamentally backtracks and how that affects Looper, and will need to be fixed in a future version of the engine. Tiny gaps in audio playback may occur between loops. May be inevitable due to Web Audio API. Some music crushed a bit. May be a limitation of the Web Audio API. If you scrub around a ton, or speed through (holding spacebar), sometimes music messes up. The engine technically works on a phone, but I've had trouble with: A) getting it into landscape mode and B) having it run smoothly. It's not a good experience on a phone in my experience, so I can't recommend it unfortunately.",Visual Novel,Anime||Cozy||Dark||Experimental||Feel Good||Kinetic Novel||pastel||relationship||Short||Slice Of Life,Breakdown,joshpowlison.itch.io/breakdown

"In Celebration of Violence is out on Steam!   A fantasy action roguelike of exploration and murder. Players move through large open lands exploring, finding/crafting/purchasing items, killing enemies, and gaining experience while preparing to fight the area's boss. The combat is deliberate and methodical, requiring the player to plan their attacks, dodges, blocks, and parries while considering their opponents and the environment. Death is permanent but players can improve their stats and discover items to aid them during future lives.   The World  Nineteen (and counting) large, procedurally generated and interconnected lands ranging from plains, to swamps, to cities, to dungeons. These lands offer multiple paths to reach the variety of final bosses. Dungeons are a dangerous but rewarding risk. In dungeons you will have to move slowly and be on the lookout for traps and secrets while searching for the exit.   Variety  Scores of weapons, items, spells, and mementos are scattered throughout the world to find. One may acquire a powerful enchanted ballista early into one life, only for the next to yield nothing more than a wooden club. That shoots lightning.   Dynamic Playthroughs  Mementos represent objects remembered from past lives and change the rules of gameplay. You may discover a memento that summons spiders from enemy corpses, improves your stats while on fire, or reverses the effects of death.   Challenge  No life is predetermined for success. Unforeseen obstacles will need to be dealt with in real time and even a regular enemy will be deadly if you're not careful. To reach the end, players will need to demonstrate that they are able to consistently overcome these obstacles. Failure can halt or even reverse progress.   Advancement  As you accumulate experience, discover schematics, and defeat bosses you can become permanently better prepared to tackle future challenges. The choices and advantages a player has at the beginning of a playthrough will dramatically increase as they play. New characters, items, and bonuses are unlocked in ways that are only hinted at during gameplay.   The Environment  Elements interact with each other and the environment. Anything flammable will burn, and the fire will spread. This includes grass, wood, arrows, weapons, and of course: people. Lightning and electricity will arc towards entities and is especially dangerous around water. The chances of rain or snow adjust organically to the area's climate and can become both a hindrance and an advantage.   Survival  Health is a resource that must be carefully managed as there are very few safety nets in place to protect those who aren't careful. Exploration carries its own risks as going without food will dampen your effectiveness. A player can run for the exit and worry little about food, but an explorer needs to efficiently plan their journey. Animal meat can be cooked or eaten raw with the risk of illness.   Economy  Players will encounter shops that offer items to those who can provide the required materials. Some materials can be gathered by breaking appropriate objects. Most objects, such as trees, rocks, and weapons, can be destroyed if a player's attack is suited for the task or powerful enough. The player can then gather materials to purchase items or trade in a market that adjusts for supply and demand.   The Pantheon  The shrines of multiple gods litter the land. Players can choose to pray to shrines they come across to receive a variety of favors, bonuses, and items. One must choose carefully though; every god has a different price and some become displeased when their rival is the subject of worship. Some gods may also become angered by actions the player takes while adventuring, such as destroying foliage or killing civilians.   Play Styles  There are many paths to victory. One could be nimble and stealthy, charge in waving a hammer, raise an army of undead, harness a variety of spells, manipulate enemies into traps or flames, amass resources to acquire the most powerful items, or simply play it safe with a sword and a shield. The various characters offer different starting points, every decision is your own.",Action,2D||Action-Adventure||Dungeon Crawler||Fantasy||Hack and Slash||Perma Death||Procedural Generation||Roguelike||Top-Down||Violent,In Celebration of Violence,julianedison.itch.io/in-celebration-of-violence
"Explore the clifftown of  Eklan Tor , located in the Hidden Lands. A tourist town,  Eklan Tor  is one of the few places in the world of monsters where humans can be found. Your mission is to find objects that have been cleverly hidden inside buildings, behind trees, and inside containers. See if you can find em all! This virtual reality game is actually a prototype I made for a larger game called  Under a Juniper Sky . I wanted to see how complex a world I could make in VR without the framerate dying. Turns out, pretty darn complex! Not only that, I wanted to create something that allowed someone to really explore a miniature world. I spent so much time on it that I wanted to give people a chance to try it out themselves.   If you enjoy the game, I know you'll like  Juniper Sky . It's the story of a girl going to visit her family, who happen to live in a world of monsters. She ends up touring the strange lands with her cousin in a traveling teacart, selling tea to the various creatures in the world. Be sure to check out my twitter and devblog to see how it's coming along!  Also if you know anyone you think might like to try this game, please tell them about it! Everyone keeps telling me that if I want to do well with my game, VR isn't that way to go since the audience is so small. But I really do love the stuff VR can do, how it can put you in a different world.  Hopefully you feel the same way.   If you like the game or know someone with VR who might like it, please let them know about it! Also tweets with this page address would be majorly great.  By the way, I have a  dev blog .

Initially it was a request by him for a project idea that could be made in a day. after throwing him some random ideas, he said he would be right back, at that time I wrote a story, just the basics. But he loved it, then I spent the next 5 hours til the break of dawn writing and expanding the story.  	Though later he decided it would not be possible in a day. we spent the next week shooting back and forth edits updates and the creation of the game within Unity (he did all the coding). The game quickly became a Imageless Visual novel.(intentionally imageless)  	But at a point he had to get back onto his other companies projects, so he sent me all of the coding that he used...

"I WAS HERE is a game I made for my capstone project in order to earn my BFA in Game Design from the NYU Game Center at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts.   Artist's statement for I WAS HERE:  I WAS HERE is a first-person narrative game where players get a voyeuristic and intimate look into the lives of others. The player finds themselves in the consciousness of Skye Lockwood, a woman taking a retrospective look into her memories of her high school relationship with her roommate at their all-girls boarding school Greybrook Academy. Players walk through Skye's dorm room and interact with the various objects scattered around the room. Doing so, they recover short audio scenes depicting memories attached to Skye and her girlfriend Olivia's possessions in the room.  I want to invite the player to think about missed opportunity, regrets, closure, acceptance, and letting go. Players will see how Skye and Olivia had a beautiful but short-lived relationship as Skye's inevitable graduation draws nearer and nearer. Throughout the game, the tension builds as Skye and Olivia fall in love and try to determine the fate of their relationship. They will inevitably go their separate ways at the end of the year when Skye graduates and Olivia is left to complete two more years of high school. The game's ending is characterized by a somber emptiness as the girls distance themselves from each other and Skye realizes that if she truly loves Olivia, she must let her go.  By the end, the audience realizes that they are Skye, now in a place of retrospection and reflection on this era of her life. Skye realizes that though she loved and lost and never fully realized the potential of her relationship with Olivia she must now come to terms with and accept that fact. I want the player to leave with the feeling that what Skye had with Olivia was real and good despite its short life and somber ending.",Simulation||Interactive Fiction,3D||Coming Of Age||Female Protagonist||LGBT||relationship||Story Rich||Unity||Voice Acting||Walking simulator,I WAS HERE,katesmith.itch.io/i-was-here

All character art belongs to Katterbox. Backgrounds, music and sounds are not owned by Katterbox, the individual licenses can be found via links within the game's 'about' page or in the README document provided with the game.  This is a work of fiction. Names, characters, places and incidents either are products of the author’s imagination or are used fictitiously. Any resemblance to actual events or locales, persons or corgis, living or dead, is entirely coincidental.  The was made for the June 2017 ""Corgi Jam"" game jam. Below the summary is a list of things to be expected with a full game release.  ----------------------------  Summary  The object of the game is to (as you may guess) adopt a corgi! The game features six corgis with different 'stereotypical' personalities from animes.   Meet the optimistic Dere, the abrasive Tsun, the weeaboo Hine, the royal Hime, the unbiased Kuu and last but certainly not least, the ""loving"" Yan. For those of you who know your anime stereotypes, you may already guess what they are like. ;3 For those of you who don't, jump on in and find out.  The simplistic stylings of the game feature mainly 'visual novel' type gameplay in which the player interacts with dialogue choices. The player can choose which dog they wish to adopt but their favorite dog may not choose the player! Your choices may matter so choose what you say carefully!  ----------------------------  The game is a demo since it was made for the game jam. If enough people like the game and want a full version with all 7 days, comment below and let me know. However, keep in mind that I will most likely want to charge $5 for a full game considering the time, effort and assets I would pour into it.  Full game features  may  include:  Fully drawn backgrounds More character expressions Seven days of gameplay (including demo days) Higher variety of sounds and music Possibility of voice acting Possible 'art gallery' feature Unique ending art for each ending Unique event art featuring special occurrences or your favorite dogs More dogs More outfits for the current dogs and more~  I have a PC and did not have the means to test the mac version. If there is an issue, I may or may not be able to resolve it. This is technically my first game ever so if there is anything I can do better, let me know in the comments!

FEATURES:  Single player (vs. Computer AI) Multiplayer (vs. friend) - Same device Easy to play, hard to master! 82 unique cards (more coming soon!) 30 - 120 minute play time 100% Anomalous and  charmingly indie  art designs!  THE CARDS:  Anomaly:  Green  , Yellow   and Red   (and rarely, purple  ) cards from the Draw pile that can only be placed on the table. Each Anomaly falls into a particular ""type"":   human,   creature,   object,   location,   event,   entity, and    infohazard/memetic. Civilian   : Blue cards from the Public pile that go directly in the Civilian Zone. Players are  restricted  to draw new civilians if they have 9+ already. However, you can still get stolen civilians. Civilian Couple & Family cards work like ""higher civilian bills"". However, they do not grant ""change"" when discarded, despite accounting to your civilian capacity. Character   : Orange cards from the Draw pile that go directly to your hand (except the D-class & such). Each player can only have 2 of these in their Personnel Zone, and 5 of them in hand. Discard any excess at any time.  GENERAL MECHANICS  Players take turns clockwise, and the first player can be decided by whatever manner. Each turn consists of four Phases in the following order:  Start phase:  Trigger the effects of any card with the  Start    symbol. Draw phase:  Draw a card from either the Draw pile or the Public pile. The effects of Anomaly cards with the Breach   symbol trigger immediately upon drawing (which must be discarded), unless you  Contain  it by discarding the required amount of civilians: Safe  : 1 civilian  Euclid  : 2 civilians  Keter  : 3 civilians  Thaumiel  : Cannot be contained by civilians. Uncontained Anomalies  without  the Breach   symbol go directly to your Uncontained zone. Character cards are added to your hand. Action phase:   Choose one action: Contain an Uncontained Anomaly   by discarding Civilians  . Play   or place    a Character   card from your hand. Placed Characters go to the Personnel zone, while played characters must be discarded. Draw once more   from the Public pile. End phase:  Trigger the effects of any cards with the  End    symbol.  Note:  Cards with the Instant   symbol trigger immediately as soon as the condition becomes satisfied, regardless if it's the owner's turn or not.  THE END GAME:   The game ends when the Draw pile runs out of cards, or when only one player remains.  WINNING:   The player with the most contained anomalies at the end wins the game.   LOSING:  Players are  knocked out  of the game either:  When they end a turn with no civilians, When they must discard civilians, but have none in their zone. (Being unable to discard a specific type of Civilian does not count)  Knocked out players must shuffle in their Anomaly and Character cards to the Draw pile.  KEYWORDS:  Site:  The area each player controls, and is visible to all players. Hand:  Cards in the player’s hand, not visible to other players. Civilian Zone:  Your civilians. Uncontained Zone:  Anomalies remain here until neutralized or contained .  Containment Zone:  Your Contained anomalies. Discard:  Remove a card from play. Contain:  Move a card to the Containment Zone Uncontain:  Move a card from the Containment Zone to the Uncontained Zone. Neutralize:  Discard. Sacrifice:  Discard. Withdraw:  Return to your hand Return:  Return to the Draw pile, then shuffle. Look:  Look at the cards, do  not  re-shuffle. Search:  Look for the  first  card of a type in the pile, shuffle it afterward. Move:  Transfer a card from a player's site to another. Whenever an anomaly is ""moved"", it becomes Uncontained again, unless otherwise stated. Play:  Use the effects of the card, or add it to your site. Suspend:  Treat the effects of a card as if the text is blank. Automatically Contain:  Immediately move it to your Containment Zone without the need to sacrifice civilians.

Sage Fusion 2 is a hybrid between Role-Playing Game (RPG), adventure, and visual novel. This is the sequel of the previously released Sage Fusion game, and is the last chapter which concludes the story. However, the game is designed and written so that new players who haven't played the first game can also play it. Sage Fusion 2 builds on the story and gameplay set by the first game, and improves them in almost every aspect: - longer playtime (Sage Fusion 2 is roughly twice as long as the first game) - more areas to explore - more engaging battles and action scenes - more interesting puzzles - faster-paced story progression Features: - Story as the most important aspect of the game - More than 120 hand-drawn backgrounds and story illustrations - A lot of character interaction and dialogue - Story-driven RPG gameplay with science fiction setting - RPG-style turn-based battle system with no random enemy encounters - Side quests - No in-app purchase",Visual Novel||Role Playing,2D||Anime||Hand-drawn||JRPG||Point & Click||Sci-fi||Space||Story Rich||Turn-based,Sage Fusion 2,kidalang.itch.io/sage-fusion-2

"""Soon... all will be lost.""  Inspired by RPGs like OFF, Undertale and Earthbound, BLANK is a role-playing game that puts you in control of Veta the Harbinger, a young female warrior born with black eyes. Life within her home of Finima Village is peaceful enough. But when a dark and twisted curse begins to corrupt the land and its people, she finds herself travelling across the world of Transech seeking a cure. Will she succeed in her mission, or is there more to this ""corruption"" than this story lets on?  BLANK includes a notable selection of features, including :  Approachable and straightforward user interface systems. One of the core foundations for BLANK's design was to allow almost anyone to jump in and play the game, even if they aren't necessarily RPG fans.  Weapon and Armor rarities, going in the order of Normal, Rare, Unique and Legendary. Key Items themselves are labelled as their own rarities.  An original soundtrack composed by the excellent Adam Halpin (StygianWhite). BLANK features over 45+ songs, all completely original for the game.

One version is the default, while the other includes the RPG Maker VX Ace RTP (Run Time Packages).  If you have downloaded any RPG Maker VX Ace games and/or assets, you won't need to download the RTP version. You can download the No RTP version of the game. But if this is your first RPG Maker VX Ace game download and you don't have the assets installed, you will need to download the RTP version.  BLANK (1.3.1 - No RTP included) = 178 MB  BLANK (1.3.1 - RTP included) = 365 MB  The game will be uploaded in a ZIP folder, so you will have to extract the files (where to is completely up to you).

"Christmas In The Coral Caves  This is my entry for Day 3 of the  PICO-8 Advent Calendar 2019  The amazing cover/intro art was drawn by  Aubrianne ⁠ !  (slightly more info may be found in  the Lexaloffle BBS post for this cart )  Controls  Gamepad is recommended! (or the mobile gamepad overlay if the web version runs well on your phone!)  If you are on keyboard, use the  arrow keys  to move, and  Z ,  C , or  N  as the ""action"" button (in-game prompts will show a  🅾️  symbol; this is a virtual PICO-8 controller button).  Backstory  Aubrianne (the same Aubrianne who drew the cover art and who I am married to <3) wrote a 100% completely original poem which provides the deep lore behind this game:  'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the sea Not a creature was swimming, not you and not me; The lights were all strung on the coral with care, In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there; The wee fry were nestled all snug in their beds; While visions of sugar-worms danced in their heads; When up from the surface there came such a splashing, I sprang from my bed to see what could be happening.  Up, up to the top I swam like a flash, Looked up through the ripples, popped up with a splash. When what to my protruding eyes did appear, But a crash-landed sleigh and eight whiplashed rein-deer, With a little old driver so frantic and quick, I knew in a moment he must be St. Nick.  They paddled like puppies, his coursers they came, And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name: ""Now,  Dasher ! now,  Dancer ! now  Prancer  and  Vixen ! On,  Comet ! on,  Cupid ! on,  Donner  and  Blitzen ! To the shore of the beach! to this lonely atoll! Now swim on up! swim on up! swim on up all!"" As awkward as kittens dropped into a bath, They bobbed and they flailed and sought for a path;  And then, in a twinkling, reindeer on the beach Were prancing and pawing the sand with relief. As I dipped 'neath the waves, and was turning around, Into the water St. Nicholas came with a bound. He was dressed all in fur, which was quite a blunder, His clothes got all soaked and were pulling him under; I was quite astonished to hear him call out to me he was waving and said with a shout  ""What ho, my good fish! You've been very good! I'm here to bring gifts to your fine neighborhood! But, alas! All the presents I brought for your friends Have been lost at sea and I might get the bends. Our tanks are all dented, and I very much fear we have only wetsuits for seven reindeer. Dasher, that rascal, lost his on that trip we took to Fiji on our polar cruise ship.  ""My friend, will you help me? I'm in dire straits For all o'er the world empty stockings await Will you find all the gifts and deliver each one? Will you wear the red hat and make Christmas come?"" I solemnly blooped and I bubbled assent I would see it through to the very last present!  His hand rose up all the way to his head and came down again with his fine cap of red He gave it to me and he said with a sigh, ""You're Santa now, fish. You are the guy!"" With a wink of his eye, he gave me a smile I knew I had nothing to fear from this trial; He sloshed to the beach, and tapped his red nose The sleigh came together and in the air rose  He sprang right aboard, the reindeer all heartened, And away they all flew, as fast as a marlin. But I heard him exclaim, as I floated, awestruck— “Happy Christmas to all, and to all, best of luck!”",Adventure||Platformer,Christmas||Cute||Exploration||fish||Non violent||Relaxing||santa||Short||underwater,Christmas In The Coral Caves,kittenm4ster.itch.io/christmas-in-the-coral-caves

"PLEASE NOTE  Fugl is currently in alpha, meaning we are still adding new features to the game and improving stability and performance. We are looking for players who want to play the early version of the game, and hopefully also get involved in its development.  The game currently has the following requirements:  64 bit only For Windows/Linux OpenGL 4.3 is required For Mac, Metal 1.1 is required A fairly modern computer with a good chunk of gpu memory is required at this stage (around 2 GB). We are working on lowering the requirements. 3 GB of harddrive space   WHAT IS FUGL?  Fugl is a sandbox game where you create the story, playing as a shape-shifting bird. Relax and feel the breeze under your wings as you glide serenely across picturesque landscapes, or kick up the excitement and soar up steep cliffs like an eagle. With no set rules the free roaming gameplay lets you discover the beauty and secrets of the world at your own pace and dares you to make your own meaning for a stress-free experience.   Fugl’s world is a vast and unique voxel playground. It is procedurally generated yet carefully crafted, with diverse areas to explore, from icy wind blown caves to tropical paradises to great deserts and old growth forests. Each environment is rich in diverse wildlife with hundreds of animals to find. You may even be lucky enough to stumble across rare mythical creatures. Come close to any of these creatures and you have the chance to take on new visual characteristics and flying behaviours inspired by them.  Give the world of Fugl your own creative touch by personalising it in the extensive level creator and craft your custom bird in the avatar editor.    CURRENT FEATURES  Freely control a bird and enjoy the thrill of flying  Experience meditative and task free gameplay at your own pace Sink into the beautiful voxel art style Discover the vast carefully crafted world Explore varied areas - from tropical beaches to snowy mountains and alien worlds Take on new visual characteristics and flying behaviours inspired by other animals  Make your own custom bird in the avatar editor Shape your personal world with the level creator Enjoy the relaxing soundtrack created with the sounds and ambience of nature Receive regular content updates throughout Early Access, including new areas, new animals and new features   ROADMAP  We are very proud of what we have accomplished so far, but we still have a few things we'd like to add to the game, before we come out of Early Access. The following are features that we'd really like to add, but everything is subject to change as development is still on-going.  Feel Free as a Bird  Expand on the core experience of flying: Add wind, thermals, clouds, day/night-cycle and different kinds of weather. Just as there are many different types of birds, we'd like to be able to support many different ways of enjoying life as a bird in Fugl.  Some are looking for a more chilled experienced,  and some for a frantic challenging experience. We are working on ways to support different modes of play. Birds can do more than just glide on the winds, break, speed up or hop on the ground and we want to support as many special manoeuvres and abilities as we can!  Fugl is not the only living thing in the world. We want the wildlife to be able to influence you, and you to influence them!  A Living World  The animals in Fugl are really important for providing a sense of life, interaction and immersion in the world.  Improved AI For the animals Better physics For the animals Physics interactions between the player and the animals Faster and improved distribution of animals in the world Animal motivations to make them more interesting to interact with More animations  Environments & Level Creator  Support for more procedurally generated content More support for user generated content like voxel models  Rendering, Hardware and Platforms  We are old-school so we are still looking to improve performance and reduce memory requirements wherever we can!

But it needs to be an uniterrupted line of the same pastry   We can only serve lines of pastries that perfectly match one of the cards. Some orders are easy to satisfy - like the x1 oders. Others may require some setup - like the x3 orders.  If we ever get stuck, we can look into the magical Star Box to activate special powers. Special powers cost stars. We can gain more stars by aligning 4 of the same pastry in a row.   We lose the game if we get stuck and run out of stars. But if we manage to serve all of the order cards in the deck, we win!

"You are POLYBOT-7, the latest in a line of  fully-modular robot designs being put through The Gauntlet.  Tactical positioning is crucial since you're not only under fire from other robots, you also automatically attract and attach nearby components until your slots are full--everything from various power sources and propulsion units to numerous types of utilities and weapons.  Your parts  will  be destroyed, but you can blast other robots to pieces and let the salvage fly over to equip you, or find caches of even better parts to really show them what you're made of!  If you're good enough, on your way through The Gauntlet take on additional challenges to acquire upgrades that expand your number of available slots until you finally have space for up to a couple dozen different components at once.  Help  In-game tutorial messages and context help will teach the basics, but key to survival is the Purge mechanic. Sometimes you may want to drop your parts, but you can only do this by""purging"" them, which destroys half of what you have while scattering the rest across the ground. Then you're free to rebuild by moving towards (hopefully) the remaining or other nearby parts that you want to attract. The Purge mechanic requires 100 turns to charge before it can be used again, however, so be careful in choosing when to carry it out.  POLYBOT-7 is available with both a tileset and in glorious ASCII form, which you can toggle at the press of a button (F3!). It also supports movement via mouse, numpad, arrows, and vi-keys out of the box, along with a ton of other customization options.  See the manual included with the game (also online  here ) for more info! (includes a list of mechanics and tips)  Installation and troubleshooting info can be found in the included readme file.  Although the download is only available for Windows, POLYBOT-7 works perfectly in Wine so playing it on Mac/Linux is possible, too. (In the latter case simply ""wine POLYBOT-7.exe"" in a terminal  will do.)  History  POLYBOT-7 was developed as a project for the  2018 7DRL challenge , based on the source of a much bigger project. For more information and development details , see the  release announcement  on the dev blog, as well as the  in-depth four-part postmortem .  If you enjoy POLYBOT-7's style but want more, check out my magnum opus that I've been working on full-time for over five years now:  Cogmind  (also on  Steam ). It features a much bigger world to explore, and far more polish and content. (You also have a lot more control over your build; while similar in style and theme, POLYBOT-7 is a rather different experience.)

"This game was originally made for the Abandoned Game Jam #2, by lacaulac (development, game mechanics and sound design) and Lutellia (graphics, level design and general advice).  You're a wizard looking for the newly discovered power of radiation, abundant in the dungeon you're currently trapped in. Harnessing the power of radiation sources will help you grow in power and make you able to fight against tougher enemies in order to get through the dungeon. Along the discovery of radioactive power, the mage community also discovered an anomaly, in the form of both alive and dead foxes, known as Srövinger foxes, named after the great mage Srövinger who first discovered them. They're present in the form of wooden boxes, which you can open to get help from the hopefully alive foxes, the problem being that there's a 50% chance that the fox will be dead when you open the box. You're able to use two magic spells: - Fayah, Left-click, 10 Mana Cost, Only deals damages. - Frizah, Right-click, 20 Mana Cost, greatly reduces the speed of the enemy while dealing some damages. The usage of radiation sources will grant you an extended amount of HP and/or Mana, as well as more HP and/or Mana regeneration.  And now, for   something completely different   the controls: - WASD/ZQSD: Moving around - LMB/RMB: Using spells - F: Try to open a Srövinger Fox box - Alt-F4: Close the game  Since I didn't have time to make a tutorial, here it is: The damages are particle based, which means that you need to be kind of close to the enemy for maximum damages (if there's only one and you're not using foxes at that moment). The green radioactive sources enhance your stats, whereas the red gives you back a part of your HP. The + and upper arrow icons respectively mean increase in Max value and increase of regeneration rate value. Red stands for health and purple-ish blue stands for Mana.  I hope you'll enjoy the game at least as much as we enjoyed making it. Feedback is much appreciated.  Special thanks for Eannyriel for helping with the conception of the Sröviner fox mechanic.

"Diesel Railcar Simulator - A train driving simulation set in the British railways of the late 1960's, modelling passenger diesel multiple units, or 'railcars', and other diesel trains of the era.  Hours of gameplay  in three fictitious routes with Inter-City, semifast, stopping, empty coaching stock and freight train services. Most passenger services have tens of departures over the 14hr daytime timetables, running times varying between 15 and 120 minutes. You can choose to drive any train while the other trains run under computer control.  Great replayability . Your driving style and timekeeping are evaluated and scored upon completing a run. Try the same run again to reach a higher score by braking more accurately or by driving more economically. You'll still need to prepare for suprises as traffic and delays may change from run to run.  For beginners and experienced trainsimmers alike . Integrated tutorials are included to assist beginning drivers in learning the train controls and operation. An optional key assistant shows which keys to press, when and why. Enable  simple controls  to operate the train with up/down keys only, while the actual throttle, shifter and brake levers are computer-controlled. Experienced drivers can operate the levers and other controls directly from the keyboard.   BR railcar classes included: 112, 117, 122, 126 and 127. Locomotives: BR Class 03 and 37. Mk1 coaches: FK, TSO, BSK and RMB. Wagons: 16t mineral wagon and GWR brake van  All parts of the vehicle drive train (engines, fluid couplings, gearboxes, torque converters) are simulated to ensure realistic behaviour  The suspension of each vehicle is made up of axle boxes, bogie frames, planks and bolsters, all individually simulated to make the vehicle bounce and sway over uneven trackwork  Three fictitious routes with different characteristics totalling over 150 miles: 4- and 2-track main lines, short urban and suburban lines, mountainous rural single track lines  Route features: semaphore signalling, trackwork with superelevated curves, clothoid transition curves and individual rail joints  Regular runs and special rescue runs where a train has broken down at one of the stations and you're dispatched from the depot to get it back   Recommended system  for decent quality graphics: Windows PC with dual-core CPU, 4GB RAM, 2GB free disc space and GeForce GTX 750 / Radeon HD 6950 comparable GPU. The sim also has lower graphics quality settings for less performant hardware.  No DRM  (Digital Rights Management) technology.  Steam key included.  Reviews (older versions):  Rock, Paper, Shotgun  -  4th's  Support:   e-mail ,  Facebook , or post a comment below!  Early Access  The simulator is in Early Access, meaning that it's incomplete and missing some features. The missing features will be released later without additional cost. You should still make the purchasing decision based on the merits of the currently available version.  Why Early Access?  The simulator has been in development for many years. It's time to get feedback from a larger crowd of players, be they experienced or beginning trainsimmers, to get the details right and see if the base concept and features could be turned into a new serious contender on the trainsim market.  Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?  The simulator is expected to be in Early Access for a few years.  How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version?  Planned additions and improvements:   More diesel trains and a train editor  Sound improvements  More detailed physics (handbrake, stopping of engines)  Graphics improvements: lighting, terrain and texturing, grass and bushes, fields and forests, roads and fences, more detailed track models, better signal models, better station platforms, improved train exterior/interior models and texturing...   For more details, please see the  devlog .  What is the current state of the Early Access version?  Apart from the train editor most base features are in place and functional. The collection of routes and trains is still somewhat limited but offers hours worth of driving. Physics and sounds are quite good but can still be improved. Visuals need a lot more work but are good enough not to distract.  Will the game be priced differently during and after Early Access?  The price may be raised with some of the updates.  How are you planning on involving the Community in your development process?  Feature requests and other suggestions will be considered for implementation if they are technically feasible and sufficiently small in scope. All ideas are still welcome even if they don't make it to the simulator.  If the community feels an important feature is not prioritised high enough, the order of the updates may be changed. The players may also have access to test versions in advance of the official releases.  Communication takes place mainly through the sim's Steam discussion forum.",Simulation,3D||Driving||Trains,Diesel Railcar Simulator,lapioware.itch.io/diesel-railcar-simulator

Take on the role of recent funeral direction graduate Charlie as she learns the ropes of the business and industry. Prepare the bodies of the deceased (via embalming or cremation), attend their funerals and listen to their loved ones' stories, and interact with Charlie's coworkers, clients, and bosses.  A Mortician's Tale is an informative, honest, and sometimes humorous look at the current state of and the future of the western death industry.  Reviews  “ One Of 2017's Best Games ... It elicits dark feelings, but asks players to consider where those feelings came from and what makes them dark.” —  Kotaku  One Of Polygon's Best Games of 2017  — ""The video game industry is built on the destruction of bodies of all kinds. How refreshing to play a game that asks you to care for them, even after their life has left."" —  Polygon  “ 82/100  — An approachable and thought-provoking meditation on life’s only certainty.”  –  PC Gamer “ Recommended  — This is a beautiful game. It scared me. It moved me. Most of all, it made me stop what I was doing and think.”  –  EuroGamer  "" 8/10  — [A Mortician's Tale] is a short game, only an hour or so long, but it leaves an impact far beyond its runtime. Give it a chance, and it might just change the way you think about death."" —  Destructoid",Visual Novel,death-positive||Female Protagonist||funeral||LGBT||Low-poly||Mouse only||Point & Click||Singleplayer||Story Rich||Unity,A Mortician's Tale,laundrybear.itch.io/morticians-tale

"""You're not prepared to deal with the truth... ...are you?""  A mysterious golden letter is sent to a select number of people... Its contents are unknown.  ----------  Project Kat is a horror rpg about a high schooler who's dead set on trying a very dangerous game. Your goal is to uncover its secrets and make sure she comes out in one piece.   This is a story-based puzzle game where each puzzle has multiple solutions and outcomes!   There is always another way. The game is playable in about 45 minutes and there is only one ending but possible differences in the gameplay depending on your choices~  Warning:  May contain some blood and unsettling scenes. Proceed at your own risk.  Just kidding it's really not that bad. But still it's a horror game :)   ----------  IMPORTANT! <3  We are 2 idiots making this game in our free time and this is our first project of this size! We would love you for eternity if you could complete this short survey after playing by clicking  here  or at least leave us a short comment and rating on this page!!  Thank youu!!  Follow the development of the game,  @twitter   Follow the artist, Kaiyakii  @deviantart    @twitter  For bug reports (or anything else)  you can send us an email at  leef6010@gmail.com .  F.A.Q.  Q:  How do I fullscreen? A:  F11  :)  Known Issues  1) When pressing New Game, the game crashes Should be fixed in v1.0.2 We've finally been able to reproduce this in-house, so we're probably close to a fix!  2) After Kat wakes up, the game doesn't respond / everything takes extremely long to happen Should be fixed in v1.0.2 This is caused by the regional settings on your computer. As a temporary fix, you can set your regional format to English (United States) and the problem should go away. This is fixed in the next version!  3) In Mac OS X Catalina, a message that says ""The application Project Kat.app cannot be opened"" Should be fixed in v1.0.2 This can be solved by giving execution permissions to the application with chmod +x as explained  here . That said, we probably made a mistake when packing the application which caused it to lose execution permissions so we'll try to fix it in the next version  (although for some reason, when we tested it on Mojave, it worked fine...) .  4) A specific crash when talking to Ponytail Girl Should be fixed in v1.0.2 That specific set of conditions was supposed to trigger a specific dialogue, but stupid me misspelled a statement in that part of the script.

If you let me know your thoughts that would be awesome of you!! 	  	Some notes: 	 There are about 10 levels increasing in difficulty. 	 Game is playable with 'WASD'+'F', arrow keys+space, or gamepad+A/B. 	 You can  swap  your  speed  with that of a  moving object  with  space/'F'  (the T-SWAP gun is basically the Portal Gun of this game - if still unclear; see the animated .gif below) 	 You can change the volume down with 'O' and up with 'P'.

If you pre-ordered the game prior to October 5, 2017, you have the full version and will automatically receive all the future routes and updates. Upon completion, the full version of the game will have 5 routes/capturable characters and more than 30 different endings.  Unfortunately, voice acting for the game will be suspended for the time being. There have been some complications with scheduling and implementation and until those are worked out, none of the released routes will have voice acting. We hope to be able to patch the voicing into the game at a later date!  		The demo covers the entirety of the common route and should take about an hour to play, depending on your reading speed and choices. Please note that Mikio and Diaochan do not appear in the demo. The demo is fully voiced.  	 Spirit Parade has been greenlit  and so everyone who pre-orders the game will also be receiving a Steam key once the game is released there. Thank you so much for your support!!  STORY   		The story centers on 	 Nara  (her name can be set by the player), a cynical 17-year-old girl who mostly shut herself off from the world after contracting spinal polio at a young age and becoming unable to walk. One night, a festival is going on in town. Instead of going with her family, Nara wanders off alone, not wanting to slow them down. As she goes through the various stalls, things become hazier and gradually Nara finds herself surrounded by people with ears, tails, and horns…then suddenly her clothes and wheelchair disappear! After a run-in with a rambunctious  kitsune  named  Hayato  and a scary-looking dragon officer of death named  Shuye , Nara finds out that her soul has left her body and has been transported to the Spirit World, where all the demons and spirits are celebrating a month-long festival. Until the end of this festival, she won't be able to return home… Will Nara survive long enough in the Spirit World to go back in one piece? Will she be able to get over her bitterness borne from the past, or will she be engulfed in hatred and lose sight of what's truly important?  CHARACTERS  		You can see a labelled character line-up 	 here , showing all of the main cast of the game.  		 NARA.  (voiced by  Jill Harris ) A resourceful, bright girl who unfortunately has suffered from spinal polio from a young age. As a child, Nara was positive and amiable, so she made friends easily and had few problems. As her spinal polio developed, however, she became overly self-conscious and paranoid. She especially hates to be pitied. While she's still kind at heart and wants to help and be useful to others, she does not expect the same in return from the world at large. Nara greatly distrusts other people and is suspicious of those who are kind to her. She operates on a one-strike policy, so once someone has wronged her she will antagonize them pretty much forever.  		 HAYATO.  (voiced by  Mark Allen Jr. ) He knew the heroine when they were kids, before her polio symptoms showed. Despite being a fox demon, Hayato frequently came to the human world out of curiosity. Being young by demon standards, Hayato is rather immature. He's also used to fighting for attention from his large family. Hayato has trouble understanding that other people are different from him and is confused whenever others don't want to do things his way. In this regard, he comes off as being very self-absorbed. It's not that Hayato only cares about himself. He does want others to enjoy themselves and be comfortable in his presence, it's just that he has trouble considering things from a different point of view. Hayato prefers spending time outdoors.  		 SHUYE.  (voiced by  SungWon Cho ) One of the  Heibai Wuchang , Shuye assists the king of the underworld with spirits, making sure everyone is in their right place. In particular, he deals with reaping good souls. Being used to dealing with the dead—who are often unhappy with their current state—he has become very patient and stone-faced no matter what the circumstances. He is a man of routine and prefers to operate in a stable, ordered environment. As a result, he is not very good at dealing with changes or at improvising. He shies away from conflict and is often called gullible or too trusting. After living and working in the court of the dead for so long, Shuye is very knowledgeable about the court, but not very much about what lies outside it.  		 HAIYUE.  (voiced by  Howard Wang ) One of the  Heibai Wuchang , Haiyue is Shuye's partner and childhood friend. He is the one tasked with reaping evil souls. Unlike Shuye, Haiyue is flighty and hedonistic. He takes every excuse to skip out on work and spend time in the tea houses above ground, leaving Shuye to deal with the pile-up of work. Despite his sweet, princely smile, Haiyue spouts insulting phrases and has no qualms about manipulating people to dance in the palm of his hand. Though he's constantly taking advantage of Shuye's gentle nature, Haiyue is protective and somewhat possessive of his friend. He views the world as black and white, but considers himself as someone who deserves to enjoy it and lord over others. He's particularly vain about his feathers.  		 MIKIO.  (voiced by  River Kanoff ) The older brother of Hayato, Asuka, and Sakuya. He was born from an earlier litter, so they should be showing him deference as the eldest still in the household… However, rather than being a dependable older brother, Mikio is a NEET and a drunkard, always loafing around the house and relying on Asuka and Sakuya to take care of him since he refuses to get a job. He says wise things from time to time, but spoils them by following up with a plea for money or more wine. It seems that he was not always like this, but his siblings can hardly remember a time when he was not a drain on resources. Mikio is good-humored and intelligent, but only when sober (which is hardly ever).  		 DIAOCHAN.  (voiced by  Natalie Van Sistine ) Renowned as a great beauty in the Spirit World, Diaochan is one of the magistrates in the underworld. However, she has seniority over the other magistrates because of her vast information network and smooth social skills. It is nearly impossible to go against Diaochan personally or politically because of the amount of blackmail material he has accrued over the years. He is a childhood friend of Shuye and Haiyue's and they all still get along, but the other two are careful never to get on his bad side. To Diaochan, beauty is very important. She can often be found fawning over female workers of the underworld and tends to spoil them while acting harshly towards men.  		 		 SAKUYA  (left, voiced by  Amanda Gonzalez ) and  ASUKA  (right, voiced by  Sarah Williams ) are Hayato's twin sisters who were born from the same litter as him. Despite their child-like looks, they are much wiser and more mature than he is. They insist on Hayato showing them deference as his older (by a few seconds) sisters and he has no choice but to listen, given how scary they are. He refers to both of them as ""aneki"". Sakuya and Asuka are in charge of the family's finances. Their family being quite large, this is something of an organizational nightmare, so the two of them have developed into rather stingy people. It's often said that they resemble yakuza loan sharks more than delicate young ladies… Be prepared to pay a lot of interest if you dare borrow from them!  		While they both have similar tastes and sensibilities, Sakuya is more outgoing while Asuka is more reserved. (Sakuya insists that her twin is not shy, only doesn't like talking to people whom she considers beneath her) Asuka usually whispers insults to Sakuya, who then transmits them to the intended recipient.

"Please keep in mind this is not a demo, but a very early prototype, showing just a small part of elements and mechanics that we hope to implement in the final game. The animations, sounds, effects, environmental art, etc. are not representative of the final product. Please, treat this prototype as an outline or a rough sketch of the game we hope to deliver.    Year 2076. The world is being rebuilt after a war and from its rubble rises a new order - UTG - United Terran Government, unifying the whole globe and setting a new, common goal for the mankind. Thanks to the advancements in robotics, nanotechnology and bioengineering, the society reached a higher level of existence - over 94% of citizens of the Earth use enhanced prosthetics or is permanently connected to the global network thanks to telecommunication implants. The implants are a product of Providers - constantly competing with each other megacorporations that supply, install and update various implants in exchange for life-long subscription. In a world without borders they decide what's good or evil, and the one which is above competition is always right. Welcome to the future, where the worth of a human life is equivalent to an average monthly salary and where corporate espionage is the new form of warfare. Have you picked your Provider yet?     We would like to start off by saying a few words about Coma's stage in its life cycle.  The project is still in very early stages of development. There are a number of features and systems having necessary scripting implemented, but they are not accessible by the player in the current build. Some systems are not yet decided upon, and have multiple versions that we consider leaving as a final one (for example: we currently have 3 versions of targeting - traditional 8-way targeting tied to movement, a lock-on system that is independent of character's movement and  direction, and a completely free, 360-degree gun rotation, à la twin  stick shooter games). Some of the features are done, but are using  placeholders - like most of current animations - while some are  completely missing. There are no real enemies in the game yet. Designing them with their moveset, animating and scripting their AI will take a substantial amount of time.  With that said, we encourage you to download the prototype and judge for yourself.    Overview  Coma is a Metroidvania-style action game set in a grim cyberpunk future inspired by the classics of the genre. Play as a member of an elite squad on a payroll of one of the Megacorporations, explore industrialized districts to find hidden, optional areas; fight with competition's mercenaries using your arsenal of weapons and unique abilities. Customize your character using multitude of passive and active implants, acquire new combat abilities and upgrade those already owned.  Main Features  Discover a dark cyberpunk world, inspired by the biggest classics of the genre, presented with beautiful hand-drawn sprites and backgrounds. Multiple playstyles. Do you like fighting defensively or offensively? Do you prefer hand-to-hand combat or destroying opponents from afar is your cup of tea? Or perhaps instead of fighting it’s better to take control of enemy systems and machines to do your dirty work for you? Agents of corporate special forces are prepared to fight in all conditions with any means. Customize your character - utilize a wide range of specialized passive and active implants to tailor the playstyle to your needs. Enhanced strength, speed, special vision filters - bleeding edge tech is at your disposal and on the house. Utilizing every advantage over your competition is mandatory in your line of work. Just remember not to overindulge in your artificial self-improvement. There’s a fine line between a human and a machine, if that’s your concern. Variety of Abilities - acquire new abilities that will help you reach previously inaccessible areas to discover secrets and most importantly - grant you new combat moves. Remember, some of the abilities will be hidden, and getting them will be optional. It is only up to you how many of them will be in your arsenal. Co-op - each agent is an expert in their field of work, wreaking havoc among the competition. Imagine the synergy between them and level of destruction if there were two of them sent on a single mission. (Crowdfunding campaign stretch goal)  Story  Exorno Tech is one of the largest and most influential Providers. Known as a supplier of high-end cerebral implants and a leader in cybernetics development, the corporation is hiding a secret. The majority of its budget isn’t assigned to R&D of new technologies, but instead to a vast network of spies and mercenaries, thanks to which Exorno is able to obtain research and prototypes from their competition and be first to bring them to market.  An hour ago, a man identifying himself as dr François Adrien Molière contacted one of Exorno’s executives. A scientist formerly working for the Abrams corp. claims he has information about new tech developed in absolute secrecy and he’s willing to negotiate the price of that information.  Chairman Gerhard Keller along with the board of directors decided to look into the matter. The chief of Exorno’s “Security Division”, gen. Stanley Vincent received an order to mobilize the special response unit. The objective is simple - contact dr Molière, verify the authenticity of the information and escort him to the extraction zone. On the surface it’s a routine operation, however the general can’t shake the feeling it will be much more complicated than it seems...  The World   In 2076 corporations rule the world. The most powerful among them are Providers - manufacturers and suppliers of prosthetic and telecommunication implants. Thanks to their influence in the still young UTG (United Terran Government), they forced a number of policies that effectively coerce average citizens to use their products. Personal data, credit and medical history and most importantly Global Information Network access - all available through the use of a single implant. The installation surgeries are expensive, additionally the implants need to be regularly replaced or upgraded to newer standards, and there are special drugs that need to be taken to avoid rejection. Not to mention a multitude of hidden additional maintenance and operational fees. Because of this the Providers ensure comprehensive implant servicing in exchange for lifetime subscription, effectively enslaving their customers.  In this world the fight for the customer is effectively fight for power and any competition is a sworn enemy. To remain on top you need to get your hands dirty. Espionage, kidnappings, blackmail, staged accidents - anything goes in the corporate war for the biggest influence, there is no place for half measures. All of this is in the job description of corporate mercenaries - top tier dirty work experts.  The game world will be divided into zones, each distinct in its look and atmosphere, all accessible from a hub zone. In the hub zone the player will be able to gather intel about an upcoming task, replenish resources, or pick up some non-essential sidequests. Fulfilling those will grant special implants, access to previously closed areas or the most valuable of all - information, that may lead to some sweet loot.  As the player progresses in the story and interacts with the world, the zones will change over time to reflect the progress, with new paths opened or old ones no longer accessible, so revisiting previously seen areas won't be a simple backtracking.  We plan to populate the world with rich and complex characters, fueled by their own goals and desires. Alongside main characters that are the central point of the story, there will be a handful of supporting cast - characters who help the player, like supervisors that give orders, comms operators monitoring your progress, offering a helpful advice, etc.  Quests  As we mentioned above, the player will be able to meet some quest givers in the hub zone. Those quests will range from fairly standard in the world of Coma corporate espionage to assassinations.  Fulfilling quests may reward you with some loot - access to otherwise not obtainable implants or upgrades, etc., some quests will have a minor impact on the upcoming missions - you may get a password to a terminal that unlocks a helpful shortcut or disables some of the security. On the other hand, progressing in the story may render current quests not finishable (for example, one of the sidequests may require gathering some data off a mainframe in a certain location but you destroyed the mainframe or the power source, and now you can't complete the quest). That said, Coma is not designed as a full-blown action RPG, with multiple branching paths in the main story and sidequests. Quests will be totally optional and non-essential part of the game, that give you more insight into some events or characters, and a tool for deeper world building.  Narration  Story told in Coma is a vision of the future encompassing technological, political and economic aspects of society and the world in general. For this reason it’s important for us to present it in such a way not to overwhelm the player.  The plot is presented in a form of a dialogue between multiple characters. Because every playable character is different, the dialogue will vary depending on their personality and relations with NPCs.  Additional information, that will flesh out the world or help the player understand the events occurring in the world around can be obtained by finding scattered datapads or hacking various terminals. Some of them may contain valuable hints or codes to locked paths or containers.  Finally, the environment will tell a story of its own. Fresh blood trails, a body lying nearby, a lost toy, an opened vent - every little detail can be a part of a tragic history that occurred in the past or a hint leading to unexpected encounters.  Exploration  While playing you will visit detailed areas, meticulously designed to deliver just the right amount of challenge from the non-linear exploration. Each area can be revisited at any point of the game, allowing you to discover numerous secrets and shortcuts, which can be reached as you gain new abilities and upgrades.   Said abilities can be used both in combat and for level traversal. For example you can use the vertical dash to reach ledges high above the reach of your jump, or use the slide dash to slide under a narrow passage.     Character Customization  Upgrades  During exploration you will come across various upgrades. Upgrades are pieces of equipment granting the characters new abilities (or expanding those already obtained) used for level traversing and in combat. Some of the upgrades are character-specific, some of them are optional and acquiring them will help you find secret pathways and areas or help you with disposing of your opponents.  Upgrade examples:  EMP - Disrupt or disable enemies’ optical cammo, find hidden paths obscured by holographic projections. Combat Hacking Module - take control over enemy drones and defense systems and turn them against your opponents. Vision Enhancement - enemies using optical camouflage or hidden in the dark won’t surprise you anymore.  Implants  One of main advantages of being a cyborg is the ability of installing various implants.  Implants are completely optional character enhancements that can add or modify already owned abilities, allowing to create many, sometimes vastly different variants of the same character, tailored to your playstyle.  Do you find yourself taking too much damage because you like to go all in? Consider installing a medical implant which will slowly regenerate your life. Do you have a problem with hitting certain enemy? Smart lock-on will take care of it for you. Experiment with different implant combinations to make the character truly unique.    The combat is one of critical elements in Coma. We want to design a combat system that’s highly dynamic, where every skirmish feels fast and snappy, the character obeys every input, while maintaining the illusion of weight and impact to the most devastating attacks.  Mobility  We want to put a heavy emphasis on mobility and versatility in combat. The player will be able to react to enemy attacks using various methods of basic and advanced controls. Apart from the fundamental movement, such as running, jumping, crouching, the player will have access to advanced movement techniques such as dashing, dodging or blocking. They can be used in combination with the directional controls, vastly modifying the performed move. Those advanced techniques will be granted by upgrades found during the exploration, and can be further enhanced to add various effects.   Firearms  The primary means of combat in Coma are firearms. However, we want to make sure the combat is not boring and tedious. To achieve that, different enemies will be vulnerable to different types of ammunition. Some enemies will have multiple defensive ‘layers’, such as heavy armor or energy barriers, which you will have to peel away. While fighting heavy-armored foes you will have to use armor-piercing ammo to strip them of their armor first, and then finish them off with the standard projectiles.  Furthermore, we want to encourage the player to use close-quarters-combat. While fighting against enemies utilizing multiple defences described above, after destroying one of the layers, the enemy will enter a dazed state, which you can utilize to your advantage by performing a melee move that will permanently disable each type of defense. Otherwise there is a chance the enemy will recover that particular defensive measure.   Further incentive will be in form of recovering a part of lost health or energy after performing those powerful attacks.  We plan for each character to have a weapon unique to them, ensuring you can pick your favorite fighting style based on fire rate, range, knockback, etc.  Abilities  Ranged and melee combat are fun, but being a cyborg brings much more to the table. Thanks to various combat implants you will be able to do much more. Hack an enemy exoskeleton to wreak havoc, use thermo-optical camouflage, hack enemy cyber implants to confuse them or hinder their abilities. Use everything in your disposal to defeat forces of your competition.  Energy  One of main resources you will need to manage, besides your health, will be energy.  Each additional passive implant will decrease the amount of available energy. Whereas every active implant will use up the energy at a constant rate when activated.  Additionally, your abilities will also use up your energy, so maintaining a balance between a number of installed and activated implants will be crucial to your success.  There will also be different ways to regain your lost energy. It will automatically recover over time, performing a melee finishing move on your opponents will replenish a substantial portion of it.  Enemies  There are many opponents that will stand in your way. Automated defense systems, cybernetically enhanced mercenaries or heavily armored combat vehicles. Your competition doesn’t like unwanted guests and will try to dispose of you by any means necessary.   Remember, your enemies are also equipped with the latest military-grade tech and will utilize every advantage against you. Their arsenal consists of:  optical/thermal camouflage combat exosuits hacking implants frag, stun, EMP grenades  and many more, requiring a different approach to every skirmish.  Bosses  While exploring the world of Coma you will face powerful boss enemies. They will range from AI-operated systems, through fierce mercenary commanders, to military vehicles, such as battle tanks.  Each Boss fight will be meticulously designed to offer the right amount of challenge and put your skills to the test. Some of the bosses will have multiple stages, where they will use more and more deadly attacks or become faster, shortening your reaction window.  You will be able to defeat them in couple of ways, such as:  direct combat - well timed evasive maneuvers and quick thinking will allow you to face the boss face to face utilizing environmental elements - lure the boss to a hazardous zone dealing massive damage, destroy sources of light making yourself harder to hit, hack and take control of defense systems forcing the boss to split their focus, and more exploit their weaknesses - e.g. destroy targeting systems on an enemy machine to make their attacks less effective  Hacking  What would a world set in a cyberpunk reality be without some good 'ol hacking?  Cyber warfare, while being one of the crucial parts of Coma's combat and exploration, it will be totally optional.  Combat Hacking  Characters equipped with a combat hacking implant will be able to take control over enemy drones, defense systems and disrupt other cybernetically enhanced adversaries, or even make them fight on their side for a short period of time.  Higher tiers of the hacking implant will allow the player to hack multiple enemies at the same time, or even perform a powerful burst hack, that will affect everything in a radius around the character.  While fighting bosses, it may be beneficial to disrupt their targeting systems, disable the most devastating weapons or hack part of the level itself to open a new path in order to exploit their weak points more effectively.  Hacking While Exploring  Hacking will be a great source to obtain new intel about forces you're fighting with, get access to previously closed paths, or get some top-secret information. That information may be valuable both to your employers or to some 3rd party that's also interested in your work.  In contrast to combat hacking that lets the player instantly take over enemy systems in exchange for energy, we want the ""exploration hacking"" to be more involved. However, we would like to avoid making a simple minigame that leaves you with just the taste. We would like to create a cyberspace where the character gets ""transported"" and is represented by their avatar, where they have to face various obstacles and challenges. Failing those challenges or getting detected will trigger defensive countermeasures. In this cyberspace the character will still be controlled like normal, but will have a different skillset and equipment. You can think of it as something similar to Shadowrun's cyber combat, where a character is represented by a powerful avatar, facing manifestations of different firewalls, defensive subroutines and tracking programs.    Engine  In its core, Coma uses Unity engine. We chose it for this project due to several reasons. First and foremost, our team had previous experience in working with it, which is a great advantage, since we know the engine’s strengths and shortcomings.   Unity offers great support for 2D and 3D objects out of the box, allowing us to mix and match various elements on the scene to achieve the look we want.  Due to its versatility, Unity can be easily expanded or modified to support new features, building on its core.  Environments  We want all the areas in Coma to be represented by beautiful, hand-crafted artwork along with real-time, atmospheric in-engine lighting that will show the duality of this dark, industrialized world, ironically lit with ubiquitous billboards advertising the latest and greatest products. Zones such as high-class districts, being gilded cages for their residents; dirty, overcrowded slums, teeming with illegal implants trade; corporate megastructures, hiding many dark secrets, for which the competition would pay a hefty price.  There’s no place for procedural world generation, no constant deja vu while visiting new locations. Every area in Coma will be handcrafted and unique while maintaining the artistic cohesion and our vision of the future.  Animation  To bring Coma’s characters to life we are using Spine. It allows us to achieve great animation fidelity thanks to its advanced skeletal animation and mesh deformation systems. Combined, these two techniques let us show off every small detail, such as movement of character’s outfit, gear, hair or facial expressions.   Thanks to the synergy between Spine and Unity, we have control of every aspect of the animations, so they can be transitioned smoothly from one to another without the erratic appearance, but where it’s necessary they can be quick and snappy to eliminate the feeling of unresponsive controls.   Using Spine’s Inverse Kinematics and Weights systems we can create complex behaviours with relatively low effort and in a timely manner. For example we can assure the character is pointing the weapon directly at an enemy, regardless of the position - whether the character is standing, jumping or kneeling. No need for hundreds of redundant animations.  That said, we need to hire animators, who can take the advantage of all those neat features, and who can create detailed, yet dynamic movements, for every playable character, enemy and boss. Install instructions We strongly recommend using an XBox controller or any other XInput compatible one. When using Sony's DualShock 4 with DS4Windows, you may need to enable option ""Hide DS4 Controller"" in the Settings tab to avoid unwanted behavior. When using any other Direct Input controller, we recommend using  x360ce  to emulate an XBox contoller.   If you can't play with a controller, there is Mouse + Keyboard support:  W, A, S, D - move / aim Space - jump / advance dialogue Shift - dash Ctrl - crouch E - interact G - grenade / skip dialogue Left Mouse Button - shoot",Action,Action-Adventure||Cyberpunk||Dystopian||Metroidvania,COMA,light-echo.itch.io/coma

"The West is Ablaze.  Heatwave is a light-hearted co-op zombie game where you and up to 4 friends battle an onslaught of sentient chili peppers to save the wild west.  The year was 1899, and it seemed that the wild west was coming to an end. But when Spicetown Industries discovered the animating power of Capsaicin238, things started to heat back up. An army of sentient chili peppers overran the salsa conglomerate and began to infiltrate the deserts, lagoons, and heartlands of the old west, turning it into a salsa-filled wasteland. It all came down to 1 to 4 online, co-op cowboys to save the world, and maybe, just maybe, the west they once knew.  Because Heatwave is in active development, there are definitely bugs, and features are subject to change. We're still adding maps, pepper species, weapons, and power-ups as we go!    Why Join the Alpha?  Play and stream Heatwave before anyone else Participate in monthly leaderboard prizes Automatic updates through the new itch.io client Get every announcement first Even more secrets and surprises inside!    Special Launch Week Bonus:  Get Serrano (VIP) status in the discord if you join before December 4th!   How it works  Waves of chili peppers will rain down upon you Shoot them, or die If you get down, a friend can revive you If that fails, you're back in (minus your guns) the next wave If everyone gets down, welp partner, you're smoked.   Leaderboard   That's right partner, there's a leaderboard. What's more? The top player on the last day of every month gets to pick a new weapon to add to the game. Check out how you match up at the link below.  Leaderboard   Features So Far  3 Unique chili pepper mutants: Fresno Reds: These babies were the muscle of the Spicetown industrial complex. They are as numerous as they are dumb. Pro tip: spray and pray. Serrano Strikers: Developed as an elite specialist in Spicetown's burgeoning private army, Serrano's are faster than a bronco with its tail on fire. They're also much stronger than their predecessors. Habanero Bombers: Spicetown Industries really made a turn for the worse with this one. Utilizing the highly refined Capsaicin238 naturally occurring in habaneros, Spicetown developed a genetically modified, heat seeking sucide bomber.  These little orange guys can spot you a mile away, and when they get close enough... boom. Pro Tip: Wait till habaneros plant and let down their shield. You'll have about 5 seconds to defuse them with your hail of bullets, but if you can win the race, that sweet Capsaicin238 might just spawn you a power-up. 6 Unique Standard Guns Magnum, Uzi, LMG, Shotgun, Capsaicin238 LMG, Capsaicin238 Shotgun. 6 Unique Power-Ups and Special Weapons Grenade, Bomb, Grenade Launcher, Flamethrower, Capsaicin238 Rocket Launcher, Capsaicin238 Flamethrower 2 Unique Maps Paso Diablo: A vast canyon filled badland with a reputation of chili colonies. What used to be the quiet western town of Rock Ridge can be seen now torn to shreds by an unending horde of the red devils. Wildfire: A high-intensity, bite-sized map. Your gang was just chillin at their camp site, which they conveniently forgot to fortify, when suddenly, all hell breaks loose.

"Ever feel like you're going crazy...  ...or rather, that everyone else is?  Awaken in the world of PEOPLEMON, where everybody wants to catch PEOPLE and make them fight!  Professor Woke takes you under her wing you as you discover the exciting future of the economy. Catch wild PEOPLE, challenge fellow PEOPLE catchers, and face off against the chief executive of Ditfy, Inc.—and president-elect of the PEOPLE!  By the end of this blackly comedic adventure, your destiny will be clear as day. And what more could a PERSON want?  A short, grim, yet affectionate parody of a global sensation from the creator's childhood. Join him for chuckles in a time-warp to some version of 1998. And if you never played the original in monochrome, then keep reading.   HOW TO PLAY  Press the  Z key  to advance dialogue and narration. You will be pressing the hell out of the  Z key  throughout the game .  Make your avatar walk around  with the  arrow keys .  When your avatar is next to something interesting, like another character, face that thing and press the  Z key  to  inspect it —in the case of another character,  he or she will speak to you . Somebody, somewhere, will have some vital clue for you.  In some places, you will be attacked. The  field screen  will disappear and be replaced with the  battle screen . You will automatically deploy  the PERSON at the top of your roster  to fight the attacking PERSON.  The PEOPLE politely fight by  taking turns . In each turn, you can take one of four actions: "" FIGHT "" brings up a menu of commands to give your PERSON; "" ITEM "" brings up an inventory of supplies for you to use; "" PPL "" brings up your roster of PEOPLE to deploy in place of your current PERSON; and "" RUN "" will make you flee the battle. Press the  Z key  to  confirm  selected menu commands; press the  X key  to  cancel  them and return to a previous menu.  Each PERSON has a limited number of  health points ; when these run out  the   PERSON is dead and gone forever!  Some  items  can recover health points before that happens.  You can use such items in the  field screen  by pressing the  Enter key  or  Return key  to bring up the main menu. From there you can also  see the status  of your PEOPLE,  switch their order  in the roster, and  view a summary of your avatar .   ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  I tried to write this game program a number of times. In the end, the only natural way to do it was writing it in Haskell using the  Glasgow Haskell Compiler . Among many other benefits, this allowed me to express much of the game in the embedded language  Yampa , created by  Henrik Nilsson  and  Antony Courtney , and maintained by  Ivan Perez .  Linkage to your system's audio and video subsystems appears courtesy of  Simple DirectMedia Layer  by  Sam Latinga  and colleagues. Two ancillary projects do some further heavy lifting:  SDL_mixer  by Latinga,  Stephane Peter , and  Ryan Gordon ; and  SDL_image  by Latinga and  Mattias Engdegård .  The Haskell  bindings to SDL  are by  Gabríel Arthúr Pétursson  and  Oliver Charles ; the  bindings to SDL_mixer  are by  Vladimir Semyonov  and  Siniša Biđin ; the  bindings to SDL_image  are by  Cai Lei  and Biđin. My personal thanks go to both Ollie and Siniša for their support.   Most of the Game-Boy-like sounds came out of  Papu  and  RP2A03 , created by  Socalabs . The drum samples in the title screen music come from  Game Boy Drum Kit , created by  Bedroom Producers Blog  and  SzcZ .  The gracious suffering of alpha testers  Michael Risse  and  Scott MacDonald  helped me make significant improvements to this game.  And finally, (again!) this work was made possible by  Gina Vasiloff  and her enduring support.",Role Playing,Dark Humor||Dystopian||Game Boy||Parody||Retro,Peoplemon,linearity.itch.io/peoplemon

You're stuck planning the Monster Sweetheart dance after being exposed to the existence of monsters. But you, your self don't have a date to the dance! through 5 different possible routes you might end up with a very special lady depending on your choices throughout the game.  Eligible Sweethearts:   Lyell:   Lyell is trusted around the town of Black wood as a reliable carpenter but keeps to herself in her cabin in the middle of the woods.  Sometimes she has to  take a break every full moon from work, no one knows why.  Bae:  Bae is the fastest swimmer in all of Black Wood , She loves to spend her time listening to music and hanging out at the BlackWater lake like she lives there.  Victoria:  Victoria is notorious for her grand parties that are very inclusive, shes the most popular girl at school after all.  While shes a  mere inane popular girl to some to you shes a childhood friend who seems to be holding secrets about her past.  Xanthe(unfinished):  Not much is known about Xanthe besides that her family is the richest in the town...and that she dated pretty much every girl in school. And it seems like you're her next target.  Lien(unfinished):  Lien has been a troublemaker since she was young considered a lost cause to many. She seems to hold in a lot of anger but for what exactly is left a mystery. Its probably best to steer clear of her.     Content warning:  A general warning of  violence,body horror and gore especially in the bad ends. So be careful if any of these things trigger or upset you in any way, especially in new versions of the game . There is also a horror aspect to this game so there will be creepy moments though rest assured there are no jumpscares .  18+ content?:  This game besides the violence does not contain any sexual 18+ content, the most you get are make out sessions and kissing.   MS is rated   PG15+.   The instinct and reason system:  These are special choices you can choose from time to time. These matter more then regular choices in the routes .  Instinct: More of a violent approach.  reason: Use your head to solve problems.    other:  this game is not the full product. I plan to Add tons more CGs later on in development and general polish, such as grammar or graphic mistakes. If you see any of these please leave a comment so I can fix it in the updated version. And if you want to see something in the game,such as mini games, feel free to comment I'd love to see your feedback! I accept any Constructive criticism.

"Four prisoners on death row are cleared of all charges. But the prison has a quota to meet.

It's mostly linear, with a twist (that'll make sense when you play it).  While playing the game, you uncover more about each prisoner.

"NEWS (22 March 2020)  Xenomarine is now at full release, and the latest version (v1.1.3) is now available here on itch at a new reduced price. Time to hunt some facehuggers!   ABOUT THE GAME: 	  XENOMARINE is a dark, atmospheric, sci-fi/horror themed roguelike in which you play a space marine exploring an alien-infested space station. Starting out with little more than a crowbar, you will fight to survive against over 120 increasingly powerful alien species, as you progress as far as you can through infinite randomly generated levels.   With no starting classes, develop your character entirely by means of in-game choices: choose between over 70 skill levels as you gain experience from combat, and create a unique build each time you play by finding and choosing between hundreds of unique usable items and individually upgradable weapons and armor.  WARNING: This game is hard! Expect to die soon and often when first starting out, and in the default 'roguelike' game mode death is permanent - meaning you will have to start again from level 1. But don’t worry: each playthrough will be different because so many parts of the game are randomly generated (in a way that’s carefully fine-tuned for balance).   	See 	 the game website  for more info and the  development blog  for details of recent updates, or 	 follow Xenomarine on Twitter    GAME FEATURES:  	  Rich, Tactical Turn-based Combat 	 Infinite, randomly generated levels 		 Atmospheric 3D lighting  Unique useable items such as scanners, stimpacks and directional forcefields 	 Over 140 unique enemy types Over 70 learnable skill upgrades Random miniquests 	 Multiple damage types and status effects Crafting (craft items from scrap and upgrade weapons and armor) 	 Hack drones and turrets; deploy traps; use alien tech  Intuitive user interface, with mouse-only and keyboard-only support Realistic sci-fi sounds including randomly generated atmosphere sounds",Role Playing,Aliens||Crafting||Dungeon Crawler||Horror||Procedural Generation||Roguelike||Sci-fi||sci-fi||Strategy RPG||Turn-based,XENOMARINE,logophil.itch.io/xenomarine

The story is set in the tutorial of the non-existing game: ""The Perfect Game"", in an office-like infinite corridor.   Infos:  This game is the result of one of my courses as a Game Design student at the BTK-Berlin university. It is more of a proof of concept that a complete game but upon seeing the enjoyment of my fellow students playing the game i decided to publish it here.

"Before you play:  Please play through the TUTORIAL if this is your first time! Currently only for Windows 52 MB download Controller recommended! PS4/Switch/3rd party controllers may not work 20-30 minutes of material + extra stuff after beating the main level If you get a FATAL ERROR with ""D3DXCompile failed"", there is a solution! You need to install a missing driver for your computer. It's simple and quick.  https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=35   This is a demo of Vivid! An indie title in the works since late 2014. This download contains an optional Tutorial Stage and a Normal Stage for you to freely play through. Try to see if you can get Gold or even the absurd Platinum Rank!  Vivid! is an action-packed platformer where your color dictates how you interact with certain objects or attack. You will need to manage your color to effectively take out targets, platform, puzzle solve, or discover new areas. Searching for Color Stars is vital for upgrading Weapons, filling your Color Boost Meter, or getting a better rank.  UPDATE 1.6.3  NEW WEAPONS! Once you beat the demo or use a special command, you will unlock some new weapons to try out! 18 in total with unique movesets and everything. If you've played before and don't want to beat the levels all over to unlock, then while on the Level Select Screen, hold UP and press whatever you have ATTACK set to. This will unlock everything for you to try out. NOTE: These weapons and such are a Work In Progress and do not have unique sound effects. They are being tested currently.  NOTE: Best played with a controller! If the controls aren't to your liking, configure them. But do tell us about any default presets for future versions!  PATCH 1.6.3.2:  Fixed some things like being able to use the dash to walljump constantly up one wall and other bugs! Also the Dash Pin functions differently!  This game has had a long time in development and I am happy where it has gotten. There is still a long road to travel before it is finished, take a look at some of my blogs for more information on the history and philosophy behind it:  https://lucasmaxbros.wordpress.com/  Please note that the music in this particular demo is circumstantial and not permanent. It will not be in the main game but we hope you enjoy it. Please report any bugs or problems. There are still many things to be fixed or added, such as a Vsync option.  One last thing: If you happen to be a speed runner or know of a speed runner who might be interested, we'd like to know! We have been trying to make this game very speed run friendly and are wondering how some might try to go about tackling it. Thank you.

Only a few months away from the end of high school, he firmly has university on his mind. One night, he decides to blow off steam at a friend's house.   Unbeknownst to Doug, a silent threat is lurking in the shadows; an ancient being stalks the streets of Penrith.   Unprovoked, it poses little threat, but something has caused this creature to stir, and Doug will find that escaping his home town may not be as straightforward as he has been lead to believe.",Visual Novel||Action,glitch||historia||Horror||Kinetic Novel||Psychological Horror||rainbow-serpent||snake,Historia Chapter 1 - Doug,lucid-a96.itch.io/historia-act-1-doug

Locked in an old laboratory ship, Blake will need to fight horrid aliens on his way to escape.   Based on the classics  Polaris was made with the classics shooters in mind, so you can expect a lot of gore, fast-paced action, and destructive guns. The game is very straightforward and let you focus on things that matter: shooting aliens to death with no mercy.

"Escape the dark, scary woods where the only enemy is fear itself.  OBJECTIVE  Find the exit of each area and move the characters on to it to leave. Try and complete the game with the most characters in the fewest turns.  HOW TO PLAY  Activate a character by clicking on their play button and see whether they pass or fail their morale test. The higher their morale the more likely they are to pass. If they pass you can either click on one of the flashing squares to move or click on the speak button to say something encouraging, increasing the morale of nearby characters. If they fail they will either move randomly or say something discouraging, decreasing the morale of nearby characters. Stick together for a morale boost, represented by the white section of the morale bar. Every turn morale will decrease if the exit hasn't been found yet. A character whose morale reduces to zero will be permanently lost.   Areas are procedurally generated so different every time you play.  An entry for the 7 day Broughlike jam.

"About This Game   	Maia is a strange and hostile alien world, toxic to humans, yet lush with new life. Your mission is to colonise this poison eden, survive it's dangers and establish humanity's first foothold in the stars. Created by independent developer Simon Roth, Maia is a space colony simulation game about surviving and thriving on another world.  Build your Base  	Burrow into Maia's mineral rich crust to build and manage a complex base that fulfills your colonist's needs. They'll need somewhere to sleep, somewhere to build and a steady supply of food, water and energy.  An Enormous Procedurally-Generated World  	 Twelve light years from earth, the planet Maia circles Tau Ceti. Its atmosphere is toxic, its surface is ravaged by solar flares, super storms, and meteor blasts and its unstable crust is constantly shifted by catastrophic earthquakes. Nevertheless, it is theoretically habitable. Explore Maia through a series of vast procedurally generated and fully simulated mission areas, each one several kilometres in size.   Challenge Yourself  	 With a fully fledged narrative campaign, stand alone missions and several custom sandbox modes, Maia has many, many ways to test your management skill and creativity.  Research the Planet to Survive  	Maia is a hard science fiction game based on real or extrapolated technology. Some of the colonist's tools have been brought with them, but others must be fabricated from what they can find. Once your base is up and running colonists can begin to study the native environment researching new ways to use the flora and fauna of Maia to their advantage.  Dangerous Atmosphere  	Maia's surface is toxic to humans, keep the colony safe by carefully managing the atmosphere around your base with well placed airlocks, atmosphere generators, heaters and air vents. Air flow and heat circulation are realistically simulated, emulating the deadly challenge of surviving on an alien world.   Advanced Colonists AI  	In Maia you don't have direct control of your colonists, they operate on their own initiative, fulfilling their wants and needs. You'll need to take care of both their bodies and minds if you want any of them to survive.  An Army of Robots  	Colonising an alien world isn't something humanity can do alone, instead they've created robotic helpers to do the jobs they don't want to. The I.M.P. robot digs through Maia's crust and collects useful minerals, while the Utility Repair Robot takes care of all that routine maintenance humans can't be bothered with.  First Person Mode  	Experience Maia through the eyes of your pet robots. Assume direct control and explore your base in first person, directly interacting with it by performing your robotic tasks. Become part of the world you've built.   Genetically Engineered Super Chickens To survive, your colonists will need to create and manage new sources of food. Build hydroponics, raise livestock and eventually capture and domesticate the alien fauna. Unfortunately most of it tastes terrible  	Maia runs on a custom game engine made by independant developer Simon Roth. It is used exclusively in Maia and is purpose built specifically to support this game.   Immersive Soundtrack  Maia's ambient soundtrack was recorded from real antique synthesisers onto tape giving it a rich and authentic science fiction feeling.  The Inspiration  Maia was inspired by games such as Dungeon Keeper, Theme Hospital and The Sims. It mixes strategy, management and construction with dark gallows humour about the many dangers of an alien world. Maia also draws from the retro future style of 1970s sci-fi.

"Now on Steam, PS4, Xbox One, and Switch!  Streets of Rogue  is a rogue-lite about player choice, freedom, and anarchic fun. The game takes inspiration from fast-paced top-down rogue-lites like  Binding of Isaac  and  Nuclear Throne , and adds free-form, experimentation-driven, emergent gameplay elements of RPGs like  Deus Ex .  Rather than taking place in a dungeon, the game is set in a functioning,  procedurally generated city , where complex AI informs denizens from all walks of life, who are just trying to get by in their daily activities.  In order to progress, the player will need to accomplish specific mission goals in any way they see fit through use of their special character traits, items, and the environment.  Will you play as a soldier who shoots first and asks questions later? A stealthy doctor who uses chloroform and tranquilizer darts to silently take down the opposition? A genial bartender who can talk his way past the most intimidating of guards? Or how about a hyper-intelligent gorilla, rescuing other caged gorillas to form a small mobilized gorilla army?   The Mighty Feature-List  Play the game YOUR way!  Don't want to kill anybody? That's cool! Want to hack computers? Got ya covered! Random world generation and TOTALLY EXTREME gameplay variety means you can play for  600 hours  and not get bored! Seriously though, go outside!!! Super-advanced artificial intelligence  that won't put up with your crap! Outsmart these virtual humans and feel superior to your computer! Play as over 40 types of characters (in the final version)! Bartender, scientist, hacker, gorilla — hey, your job is probably in there too! Stupidly huge number of items (in the final version)! Shrink rays, hypnotizing devices, boomboxes,  bear traps , food processors.. Oh, and guns too. 4-player local and online coop modes  lets you brutalize goons AND loneliness!  Online mode currently available in the Steam version. Lead a gang, free slaves, drink beer, gib ghosts, become a vampire, shrink people and stomp on them. The most insanely varied game ever made.

There are no elves, dwarfs, dragons or other classical fantasy creatures. There are some light magical elements, but no overwhelmingly powerful sorcerers either. Many centuries past, Giants roamed the world, living peacefully alongside humans until the war between the two species left the Giants extinct. Some years ago, a cabal of scientists discovered a process to extract the Life Essence of the ancient Giants from their bones.  This mystical fluid promised to cure many different diseases, mend grievous wounds, and perhaps even halt the aging process. Unfortunately, instead of improving the health of the subject, very often the serum would have the opposite effect, inflicting a mutation or lethal disease. Until the exact nature of this wondrous medicine can be determined, experiments on unwilling subjects continue.  The story begins when the main character, Urtuk, escapes from the Sanatorium, a facility where these experiments are carried out on abducted commoners. Urtuk suffered a severe mutation from his exposure to the Life Essence, and with every passing day his health worsens. Now he wanders the world in search of a cure. Unless he can find a way to counter his evolving mutation, Urtuk must eventually die. 	   If you like a more direct communication with us, please join our  Discord server .

"Will you make love and risk death?  Assume the role of a praying mantis in a relationship. Constantly torn between their mutual love and the instinct to have sex – which could lead to the male mantis’s death – the couple are now on the verge of making a decision. Assume the role of either of the lovers, and try to keep their relationship in balance. Do your best to convey your feelings in a situation with no solution.  Feature list  Type your answers freely and watch the conversation unfold. A lively character that reacts to you in a meaningful way. Multiple endings and nonlinear playthroughs. Hand-drawn art style with a cinematic feel. Dynamic soundtrack that changes according to your partner’s mood.  FAQ  One playthrough is pretty short. Why shouldn’t I get a refund after I finish it? While it’s true that a single playthrough is short, you’ll need more than one to access all the content – the total being roughly the length of a “normal” short game. If that’s still too short for you, how many times have you put a lot of effort into something but that effort wasn’t acknowledged? It’s often difficult to understand how much time and money goes into what we experience as entertainment, but we’re sure you can see where we’re coming from. That’s why we hope you’ll consider this a fair price for the kind of experience “Don’t Make Love” is. Can I really type  anything ? Yes, technically you can, but you won’t always get a reply. This game puts you in a specific situation: a conversation about a relationship in stalemate where your partner is trying to tell you something. If you don’t take on that role, the game will ignore most of what you type, but if you try to “stick to the script” you’ll notice how the game can understand you and respond appropriately. Why is the game only available in English? We would love to cover as many languages as possible. Unfortunately, recognizing open input from the player also requires knowing the grammar rules of the player’s language. We are a small team, and converting the system to support more languages would be a tremendous amount of work that we couldn’t take on. If the game proves successful, however, we’ll consider this possibility.    	Consider also to follow us here, on 	 Twitter  and/or  Facebook  and subscribe to our  newsletter .   Reviews  “...this is an extremely deep dive into a moral dilemma – and one with more than a little resonance for role-reversed human fears” Rock Paper Shotgun  “With tons of different paths to clear, Don't Make Love puts up a challenge for players that may seem deeper than a couple of bugs fighting instinct. Under a thin veil of insect-love, players may find themselves in extremely deep, meaningful conversations about love and necessity.” IndieGames.com   ""[The] characters are beautifully drawn, with just the right amount of earnest silliness to make you eager to inhabit the spiky bits of your chosen proustian predator. The wistful guitar music drifts through the pale light of the windy field in which these two lovers find themselves in heart rending ultimatum."" NewNormative.com  Thought-provoking and emotionally charged, Don’t Make Love is a title worth trying for yourself, especially if the mood for something less gamey and more emotional is right up your alley.

So, thinking about the end of this year and what I learned, I decided that I wanted to do a reboot of the game in Bitsy. That way I didn't have to focus so much on the graphics and could focus more on text.    Using randomized text, there are tons of plants, interpretations of tarot cards in the major arcana, gemstones, and spells you can unearth on multiple playthroughs. It's not so much a story as much as it is just an interesting exploratory escape.   Just as in Activist Tea House, this game is an experience for people that need to take a break and be somewhere beautiful and have a cup of tea, or something else.   🌸Thank you for coming and I hope you enjoy your time in SweetPea Village🌸",Simulation||Interactive Fiction,16-bit||Bitsy||Pixel Art||Relaxing||resistjam||tea||Walking simulator||witch||witch-coven,SweetPea Village,magicalbitch.itch.io/sweetpea-village

"Welcome to DLS, the digital logic simulator game.  	The current version of the game includes:  	 Truth table  levels where your goal is to build a circuit to match a given truth table, under certain restrictions (e.g. limited types of gates). 	 Sequential  levels where your goal is to create a circuit to match a given timing graph. 	 Stream  levels where you have to build a circuit to process several inputs streams and produce the desired outputs. 	 A powerful  sandbox editor  where you can build whatever circuit comes to mind! Includes a logic analyzer to debug your circuits, calculate propagation delays and/or find hazards and glitches. Create and organize components into packages and use them to create larger and better circuits.  WARNING: The macOS version has been tested only on Mojave. A few users reported that it doesn't work on newer versions.  Links  Sandbox (browser version) Blog Twitter GitHub (demo schematics & issue tracker) Sandbox manual  DISCLAIMER : This is an alpha version of the game. Although the simulator is capable of handling relatively complex circuits, you might find that certain configurations don't give the expected results. If this is the case, you can send us the schematic in question to find out what's going on and how we can fix the simulator.  Technical   	DLS is a 	 time-driven event-based multi-delay 3-value  digital logic simulator.   	 Time-driven  means that the circuit time is advanced forward based on a user-specified target speed, which is measured in circuit nanoseconds per real second (ns/s). The simulation will always advance to a new state if there are pending signals in the circuit's queue. This means that even unstable or asynchronous circuits can be correctly simulated. 	 Event-based  means that a gate is simulated only if one of its inputs changes value. Otherwise the previous output is considered valid and used as input to all connected gates/components. 	 Multi-delay  means that each build-in gate/component type has its own propagation delay which is always an integer greater than or equal to 1. 	 3-value  means that in addition to logic levels 0 and 1 there's an extra logic value (U for Undefined) which is used as both Z (high impedance) and X (undefined) signals, depending on its origin.   Third party libraries  	DLS uses the following free software (in no particular order):  	 GLFW - An OpenGL library ( http://www.glfw.org/ ) 	 bgfx - Cross-platform rendering library ( https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx ) 	 zange - A single header ANSI C JSON parser ( https://github.com/vurtun/zange ) 	 bnet - Message oriented networking library using TCP transport ( https://github.com/bkaradzic/bnet ) 	 CrashRpt - A crash reporting system for Windows applications ( http://crashrpt.sourceforge.net/ ) 	 Lua ( https://www.lua.org/ ) 	 Icons from Font Awesome - the iconic font and CSS toolkit ( https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/ ) 	 Roboto font ( http://www.dafont.com/roboto.font ), Anonymous Pro Minus font ( http://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/anonymous-p... )   	We would like to thank their developers for building them and making them public/free.

NEW: HDL: Added muxn() and bit_length() functions. FIX: Crash on macos with Metal renderer when creating pixel displays. FIX: Changed propagation delays of HDL-only simulation components. FIX: Crash when calling tick() in testbenches without a clock name. FIX: HDL: Register's default value after creation is now itself. FIX: Clock frequency in clock configuration dialogs is now displayed properly. FIX: Logic Analyzer: Center the value of multi-bit signals inside their box even if the box is larger than the screen.

"-Do you love me or the idea of loving me- This is a story of a young researcher who, despite working at a laboratory for the study of oceanic cryptids , has never seen anything of the sort. When they help bring in a mermaid, the beauty and mystery of the creature instantly captivates them. The two struggle with their feelings and soon a big choice has to be made. Caught by a Lure  is a short Visual Novel created by MakioKuta and Racheal in a month for the 2016  ILUjam . As such, it's a game centered around romance, though I make fair warning that it's not the happiest of romances. The line at the start of the summary was the theme I wished to explore with it. The game features four different endings, each more  cheerful  then the last. Originally we had planned for the story to have two main routes, one told from the researcher's POV and the other through the mermaid's. Unfortunately, time didn't allow us that luxury. We'll update the game at a later date with the other side, but for now you can only view the story through the researcher's eyes. We were running REALLY close to the deadline of the jam, so the game is not as tested as the things we typically like to release! So if you see any typos, please let us know in the comments section below. Also, due to the lack of time, the backgrounds in the game are sketches for the most part. They are sketches with pretty colours - but I hope they don't detract from the game! I know this may be a bit of a different spin on the romantic theme for the jam, but I hope people enjoy it.

"This  game was made in seven days for the 2018 Seven Day Roguelike Challenge!  Shift Stack   is a puzzle roguelike where you play as a scientist who must defeat the experimental monsters that have been unleashed in his lab. The only problem is as a gentle scientist you don't know how to use any weapons or even fight with your hands. The only tool at your disposal is your teleportation pack, which allows you to warp between the six levels of the lab. There's probably some way to defeat the monsters with that...  Defeat all four monsters to win!  CONTROLS  W A S D  - Move around.  Press  O  and  P  to warp to the next and previous levels. Warping uses power! (You can also use the bracket keys: [ and ] for this).  Hold  SPACE  and press a warp button to look at the next/previous level without warping (this uses no power).  M  - Murder the scientist yourself ... in case you get stuck. Not because you hate scientists.  R  - Change the size of the game.

"Nina`s Garage Tradle  is a 2D shop management game where you help an 8 year old girl reach her goal of getting the brand new Twinkle Starlight unicorn mug. To reach her objective she decided to sell some things she found in her house (with her parent’s authorization, of course). Unfortunately, Mommy and Daddy told her that she isn’t allowed to mess around with money because it’s “dirty”. Because of this condition, she had to come up with a work around. Her answer: Nothing in the garage sale will be sold, only traded.   Help Nina make the right decisions and amass enough goods to eventually trade for the mug she so desperately desires.   The Game When someone comes to offer something, the objects they have to trade will appear in a window. To convince them to trade, you have to  offer something they think is worth the trade . Only then can you click on the ""Accept"" button. And if you don't want to bargain, you can always just say no. Different NPCs have different tastes, and  that shows in the way they dress . Pay attention to the traders and try to find out what things they like best!

"EverSector is a space-themed sandbox roguelike with an emphasis on simulation, set in a large yet finite universe. Unlike similar roguelikes, EverSector puts you in control of a starship itself. The universe you will navigate is divided into sectors, filled with planets, space stations, and other ships. These ships are no different than yourself: competing for resources and waging war for their respective factions. With enough hard work, any ship can rise to power over their faction, through noble or despicable means.  EverSector is written in Java and displayed with  AsciiPanel  by  Trystan Spangler , as well as my own library,  APWT . It uses  SquidLib  by  Eben Howard (Squidpony)  for random generation, FOV, and other calculations.  For more information, check out the README when you download the game.

"Website  •  Facebook  •  Twitter        CROSSNIQ+  (CROSS-neek plus) is a speed-focused, arcade-style puzzle game inspired by ""y2k-era"" visual design - a tribute to highly polished, small-scope Japanese games from the late 90's.   In CROSSNIQ+, the name of the game is re-arranging a grid of tiles to form  ""crosses"" - rows and column of the same color.  You can move tiles up, down, left or right - but moving them off the edge of the grid makes them wrap back to the other side, offering a unique and brain-bending challenge that's been compared to a mix between matching games and a color cube. Unlike other popular puzzle games, CROSSNIQ+ focuses on speed and technique rather than chains or combos - make crosses quickly and set up multi-crosses to earn bonuses.   In Endless mode, keep making crosses to keep your timer filled - let it hit empty, and your game is over. In Time Attack, your time is a set amount - earn as many points as you can before the buzzer sounds.    Play against a friend in Versus, complete with items and special moves...   ...or simply relax to a variety of different, aesthetically striking playfields in Chillout mode, where there's no score, timer, or game overs.

"NOTE: Game works best in Firefox or Chrome Thank you for checking out the Alpha version of  Chasing the Manic Pixie Dream Girl: A Game About Love, Consent, and Respect This game is inspired by my research into the performance of gender in online culture and how the tropes of online games are starting to make themselves felt in real world scenarios.  One of the most explicit places I discovered in which the real world was being ""gamified"" was in the world of Pick Up Artistry, where dating guides claim to know the ""secret code"" to unlock a girls' heart by breaking down her self esteem and her will to resist. Reading these manuals (which are rife with references to ""video game bosses"" and ""high scores"") put me in mind of one of my favorite films: Harold Ramis and Bill Murray's  Groundhog Day .  In many ways, this film resembles a video game.  Murray's character must relive the same day over and over until he achieves a perfect run, doing everything exactly right so that he can finally win over his co-worker.  Getting the girl becomes the same as ""beating the game"" and escaping the loop of failure in which he is trapped. After reading up on Pick Up Artistry, I started to re-think the film and I recognized some of its less savory characteristics.  The film posits that Murray's love interest isn't really a person with feelings and desires in the same way that he is.  Rather, she is an obstacle that must be overcome, an adversary that Murray must defeat to gain access to her prize: sex (and, presumably also love).   If occurred to me that this is a pretty poor vision of love.  If attraction is simply the irresistible product of the perfect mix of piano recitals and ice sculptures and town dances and not something that your partner can equally choose, then it doesn't, to me, seem to be something that a healthy person would want. I began to wonder: what if we reverse the central premise of  Groundhog Day ?  What if we created a story with a time loop at its center in which the protagonist has to learn that there is no such thing as a perfect run, that a person's feelings are their feelings and that they cannot be changed with a single social formula or an isolated Big Romantic Gesture.  What if Murray's character in  Groundhog Day  had to learn acceptance instead of how to conquer? This is the result of that thought experiment. Note that the gender, race, body type, etc of the protagonist, CJ, are all  deliberately unspecified.  This is for two reasons: first, visual novels typically do not show their protagonists or allow them to speak so that the player can project themselves more readily onto them.  Second, I wanted to make the protagonist as accessible to as many different types of players as possible, both to make the game more welcoming to players of all types and also to prevent players from blaming CJ's girl troubles on something irrelevant to the story.  Masumi isn't rejecting CJ because of their identity or their body or their fashion sense or their money situation.  Masumi just doesn't feel about CJ the way that CJ feels about her.  And this game is about CJ learning to come to terms with that fact, to give up feelings of entitlement and shame, and to move forward with life, finding new opportunities to grow and love along the way. Please feel free to report any issues, from game breaking bugs to spelling errors, via email at megancondis@gmail.com  And send along your comments, good or bad! This game will always be free to play. But... Look for the forthcoming Kickstarter for the Ultimate Edition, featuring: More costumes! More facial expressions! More sound effects! Voiceover? Downloadable versions for Windows and Mac? Android and iOS versions? And who knows what else? The Ultimate Edition will help support the writer and the artist as they make more educational games and interactive pedagogical... things.

"The Stillness of the Wind , follow up to Where the Goats Are, is  out now!    ""While Tikvah and her goats might meet an ultimately tragic end, the fleeting, quiet moments before this asked me to appreciate the small things while I could. "" Lewis Gordon,  Waypoint ""Where the Goats Are seems to unfold like a tableau."" Stephanie Chan,  GamesBeat  ""I like its simplicity, and the solace that comes from designing your own daily routine."" Samuel Horti,  Rock Paper Shotgun   Where The Goats Are is a slow-paced, meditative videogame for PC and Mac, created by solo indie developer Memory of God. Play as Tikvah as she tries to maintain her way of life, looking after goats and making cheese, while the world around her falls apart.  The experience lasts around 1 hour. The game automatically saves at dawn everyday, however I recommend allowing time to play through the entire game in one sitting.

"If you are sensitive to descriptions & images of extreme bullying and abuse, please hit the back button now.   —Despite all the singing around her, her world was soundless.  A small village cut off from the rest of the world, Phada, spends its days slowly, idling away time by speaking with one another, eating with one another, and dedicating all their attention to studying scripture. With a population of only 145, the governing body of the town is the Group, the name of the miniscule clergy that inhabits the church at the top of the hill. They worship a protective God comprised of two halves: the ""Barrier"" defensive energy and the ""Expulsive"" offensive energy.  In a town where all you can do is socialize, young Mercy is denied this. Since birth, she has seen the unseen, and was taken in by the Group after losing her parents. Upon turning 10 her vision seemingly became corrupt, causing panic among the villagers. It was decided by the Head Priest and the Holy Woman that the only way to deal with this curse is to aggressively apply the ""antibiotics.""  In other words, isolate Mercy until she stops seeing things.  Now an empty shell of who she once was, 15 year old Mercy attends school and is constantly bullied by her classmates, some truly afraid of her, but most seeing her as an easy target. The sudden death of the 25th Holy Woman startles the village, causing many to believe Mercy's curse is spreading and for her abuse to become more aggressive. Then, one day, the Head Priest reveals God has given them two young Holy Women rather than one.  When classes end the next day, one calls out to Mercy.  ""I can see it, too.""

"Explore the lost city. Find the amulet.   	 The Remains of El Dorado  is a roguelike game for PICO-8.  You're seeking  The Amulet of the Sun  which will bring you great fame and fortune... if you survive.  How to play  	 Remains  is turn based.  When you're in a tough situation don't forget to  slow down  and think about all of your options.  Don't die with a potion in your pocket!  	 PICO-8 Buttons   	The PICO-8 console has a directional pad and two face buttons.  The arrow keys on your keyboard control the directional pad.  For the face buttons, there are multiple mappings:  	   	Personally, I prefer to use the X and C keys.  	 Controls  		   	Press C to charge a shot, press a direction while charged to shoot.  Press X to enter the potion menu.  Select a potion by pressing left and right, and press C to confirm.  Aim your throw with the direction keys, and press C to throw the potion.  Careful!  Potions will explode on contact with a wall.  	 Potions   	Potions are thrown around like grenades!  On impact they will affect everything standing in the square they hit plus the 8 squares surrounding it.  	 Healing  potions heal you if you're in the explosion.  Enemies are unaffected.  They also put out fires in the blast zone.   	 Fire  potions are useful for attacking groups of enemies.  They don't put out fires.  The fire ants are immune to fire potions.   	 Ice  potions are slightly harder to find than fire potions, but work on all types of enemies and put out fires.   	 Confounding enemies   	Three types of enemies inhabit the dungeon and will defend their turf.  	 Ants  start fires in the square in front of them.  Fires spread one square per turn in a straight line.  Fire hurts, don't stand in it!  	   	 Lizards  will slurp you.  They are more timid than the ants and will not approach too closely.  Don't get distracted or you might get caught by surprise.  	   	When you enter a room with a 	 cultist , they will teleport you to a random square in the room.  This will lead to some sticky situations, so try to have a potion ready!  They also teleport themselves around and stab you if you stand too close. Scary!

"You have been part of something terrible, something so unspeakable that caused you to blackout and forget all recent events. Now you have the choice of pursuing this dark truth or trying to bury it in the past.  Maybe it’s not too late to turn back now.  --  Pre-order now at a discounted price!  Blackout  is a non-linear interactive fiction game set in a dark modern universe, influenced by  White Wolf’s World of Darkness ,  H.P. Lovecraft  and weird shows like  Twin Peaks .  You play as a man who finds himself lost in a dark street somewhere in the city of New Wenders. It doesn’t take long before you start having flashbacks and regaining your memory. Something terrible happened, and you were part of it. This event somehow opened your eyes to a whole new world that has been hiding beneath the shadows.  As the player, you have the choice to dig deeper into this unspeakable deed or try to leave it all behind. Blackout is a game about  choices , every chapter of the game takes place in a different location, and the order in which the chapters take place will change based on your  choices . Even more so, the path you take inside each chapter varies greatly, and the effect of your  choices  could ripple across all chapters, meaning you could have a completely different experience on a new playthrough.   In  Blackout , you have 3 attributes that will change during the game:  Courage, Sanity and Fitness . These attributes will also lock or unlock  choices  or paths, as will some items you may acquire along the way.  Blackout  is a game about  hidden monsters and hidden fears , and ultimately about overcoming the worst adversary:  one’s true self .  --  You can also  add Blackout to your wishlist on Steam ! If you buy the game here, you'll also get a steam key ;)  The  preview  version (Demo) of the game, contains the first chapter (from a total of 10), but it still lacks some of the functionalities of the final game and is likely to have text issues or bugs. The intent is to get some feedback and support while we finish the rest of the game, and also most of all to help spreading the word.

"A Gift For Her WEB VERSION :  http://www.ninacode.work/extracredits/  Fight your way through bugs as you pick flowers for a lovely friend of yours! About : This is my second real attempt at a complete game, and my first Unity game! Any feedback is very welcome and very wanted. This game was completed with 1 day left in the jam, as I felt like I reached my conclusion. I learned so much this time. Known Issues : - When moving and using a tool, sometimes movement can become locked. Try pressing the corresponding direction you're locked into to release yourself from the forced direction. - Hitboxes are a little wonky, not sure how to make sure they trigger without clicking often. - Cutscenes at the end don't render the tiles correctly and I'm unsure why. I'm using a pixel perfect camera and the same way I render the game, yet it still shows strangely.

"A  game of terrariums.  Tree game is about making tree's and gardens for them. Customise tree's  and their gardens by either hacking them using a command line system to have as many happy accidents as possible, or in a simple mode that allows for total control.

Using L-Systems to procedurally generate the tree's means you have total control over their shape and look.  The game features three modes:  Hacking:  Tree's and Gardens are edited using a command line. Saving and loading, tree's and gardens on to floppies.

When the tree is made this will make a peice of tree.  e - denotes a step forward in the same way as a but ends in a leaf.  [ and ] - denote a branch.

He has never worked a day in his life, which is immediately evident in his attitude. He interacts with the world as though everyone has an obligation to cater to his every need. Sometimes, however, he will erupt in bursts of anger when prodded about his family.   Alan Dalencourt  Alan is gentle and soft-spoken. He has a tendency to trust people, and this hasn’t become a problem due to Olivier’s protection. His passions can be riled when talking about music, especially the cello, but otherwise, he has difficulties with interpersonal communication.

"A small rogue-like game centred around an enigmatic character blasting through enemies in an attempt to better themself, expanding their memory to gain addons and build strength until they fall.    Controls  You can navigate the game world with the WASD keys and aim with the mouse, shooting with the leftclick key.  Active Abilities can be found throughout the game and used with the 1 and 2 keys, respectively, based on their slot.   Gameplay  The main goal of each stage is to kill all the enemies in it, using your weapon. There are 4 weapons that can be found by killing enemies. When killed, enemies also drop Bytes, which are converted into MB when you get enough, and are used to download Skills at the end of each level.   Each weapon functions different from the others, and can be upgraded by getting other weapons using an upgrade, and merging them at blue bordered stages.  They can receive modifiers to apply effects to enemies on hit, or to modify the weapon's mechanics.   Stage Rewards  Some stages can be cleared to get rewards, and will be indicated so by the coloured square that appears around its tile on the level select screen.  Green borders mean the stage will award 5MB on completion to be spent on skills Yellow borders mean the stage will award a bonus to one of your stats on completion Blue borders mean the stage will combine your weapons together on completion Red borders mean the stage will contain a boss, which gives a specific Skill when killed, depending on which boss is chosen   Join the Holy Mango discord!

"Beacon follows the journey of space privateer, Freja Akiyama, on her endless search for her crashed ship’s emergency distress beacon. In your search you’ll not only find weapons and items to help you; you’ll also be collecting DNA from the enemies you defeat. When you inevitably die, you’re given the opportunity to integrate the DNA you've collected into your genome, allowing you to alter your statistics and gain gameplay-altering physical mutations for your next clone's life.  In the search for the Beacon, new questions arise; just how many clones of Freja are there? How long has she been stuck in an infinite cycle of survival? How much of her humanity will be sacrificed before escaping?    5 Randomly Generated Levels  -- Enter at the outer forest, fight your way through the tropical swamps, and push through the pollution to the cryptic Prism Vault where your Beacon is being held A rich multi-faction world to scavenge  -- Discover the mysteries behind the planet Kovus 18, find tinkered Weapon Variants left behind by previous clones, and track your percentage of secrets found at the end of each level 75+ Mutations  -- Gain new abilities with each death and alter your character into something not quite human 50+ Enemies with 8 Champion Variants  -- The varied factions that inhabit Kovus 18 will fight each other as well as you 75+ Weapons  -- Spread across 5 factions each with their own unique technologies 125+ Items Spread Across 4 Item Types  -- Regain an advantage with one time use Pickups, activate your re-useable Auxiliary, swap your Grenade Mod, and stock up on Passive Mods 8 Unique Weather Types with Storm Events  -- Avoid or make use of Hailshards, Tesla Storms, and Polluted Tornadoes 3 Act 1 Boss Fights  -- Including the Solus Hivemind and Excavation Spider      DNA is the core of Beacon’s gameplay loop. Through the use of Freja’s state-of-the-art Clone Bay and DNA dropped by deceased enemies, upon death you’re given the opportunity to alter your genetic makeup, changing your statistics before a fresh clone is ‘printed’ back at the beginning of the game. Each faction has their own set of unique DNA and mutations, allowing you to become a battle-hardened mass of metal, a luminous abomination of insect flesh, or anything inbetween.     The planet you've crashed on is unfamiliar. The only information available is its name – Kovus-18 – as it flashes up on your Visorsys OS; the rest of the record is blank. It seems that either nothing is known about it, or whatever  was  known has been scrubbed from the database. Multiple factions populate its surface, each seemingly at war with the others, and all of them hostile to the planet's newest inhabitant… you.      In Beacon, you play as Freja Akiyama. Having grown up in the backwaters of civilised space, Freja always dreamed of adventure. Enrolling in the military at a young age, she quickly discovered both her natural abilities for combat and piloting spacecraft, and her inability to work within the strict regimen of the armed forces. Freja lives and works aboard her ship, the Ouroboros – a single-berth, heavily-modified light spacecraft that boasts state-of-the-art weaponry and facilities.

"COLUMNAE is still under development, and this is a small demo from 2016.  If you like it, consider supporting COLUMNAE via Paypal and you will get a copy of the full game when it's out (2020):  moonburntstudio.com/paypal.htm   ""COLUMNAE: A Past Under Construction"" is a non-linear point & click adventure game set in a post-apocalyptic steampunk world and developed by Belgrade-based Moonburnt Studio.  Aside from the classic point & click adventure features, COLUMNAE introduces the  concept of retrocausality  which along with non-linear nature of the gameplay allows the player to affect not only the future but also the past of the main character and the world surrounding him. The game is divided into eight chapters, but the order of playing them is not chronological. Depending on the actions the player chooses within each chapter of the game, yet-to-be-played chapters are placed in an appropriate ""version"" of the past or the future. COLUMNAE is set in a  world ruined by a gradual environmental catastrophe  that left the surface of the Earth uninhabitable. The story is focused on a society descended from people who couldn't afford to inhabit the ""city in the clouds"", called Deus, when the ecological disaster was imminent. Deus is a closed town built upon gigantic metal pillars - Columnae. Beneath them, a huge underground machine, called Machina, was constructed with the purpose of automatically extracting and processing resources and sending them via pipes through Columnae and into Deus. The society now living inside the columns settled there in an attempt to escape the lethal environment on the surface after Deus was locked down. Since then, they had no contact with the inhabitants of Deus, and they are parasitizing on the resources coming through the columns. But the people living there are far from innocent themselves - power struggle, corruption, lies, political manipulation and poverty are all present among the citizens of Columnae.",Adventure,Nonlinear||Point & Click||Post-apocalyptic||Steampunk,COLUMNAE: A Past Under Construction,moonburntstudio.itch.io/columnae

This is a text-based game where you view the sights and sounds of the sunset and provide a space to inhabit your personal thoughts and feelings.   It was inspired by my experiences with meditation and the process of how innocuous thoughts could lead to more personal ones in a nonconfrontational way.  As such there are multiple conclusions you may reach with yourself.   Will you experience joy? Sorrow? Love? Loss?  Remember, your thoughts are yours alone to share.   - Mudita Heart  Donations of whatever you can spare are welcome to continue funding development of Reflections at Sunset and future projects.    Website:  http://charleshanshuang.com/reflections-at-sunset/ Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/ReflectionsAtSunsetGame/ Twitter (game):  @reflectatsunset Twitter (developer):  @CharlesHHuang",Interactive Fiction,artgame||Experimental||First-Person||Global Game Jam||Short||Singleplayer||Story Rich||Text based||Twine,Reflections at Sunset - A meditative Twine experience,muditaheart.itch.io/reflections-at-sunset

"a game with no focus, only dreams and ideas. a mashup of pre-existing visual assets, new musical work, and nearly anything i want to prototype and play with. the lack of theme is the strongest theme of all.  a lightly and abstractly story-driven single player STG-platformer hybrid focusing on weird scoring systems, inconsistent and cryptic rules for those scoring systems, and difficulty that will only push you as hard as you push it - except the boss encounters. they always push, and if you don't put in the effort leading up to them, you won't get far.    悪魔の悪夢 is being built in  Clickteam Fusion 2.5 . it makes use of  Josh Whelchel's Onu Core ,  Ultimate Walrus' Ultimate Fullscreen ,  z33z's Flag and Time X Objects ,  Turboferret's 3D Mesh ,  Cellosoft's Text Blitter ,  Anders Riggelsen's Perspective and Parrallaxer , and  Looki's shaders .    nearly all of the graphics used come from other games. a full list of sources is available in the game's credits, accessible from the main menu. some additional illustrations by friends are being used to bring it all together.  i haven't set too many specific limitations in terms of graphical fidelity. the palette is not all that limited, but calls from the Mega Drive palette frequently. overall, the look i'm going for is kind of like a 32-bit sprite game with a couple more modern tricks (namely subtractive faux-lighting overlays)     this is where i wanted to really evoke a consistent ""specialized hardware"" feeling. i decided to use music in Impulse Tracker's IT format with a set of self-imposed limitations for the music. i also disabled the anti-aliasing on the IT playback, as i really like the oldskool ""tracker sound"" of aliased samples. a large amount of the soundtrack, including many pieces not yet in the game, is available on  my bandcamp page .  the sound effects work outside these limitations (a few more channels of PCM, FM, and PSG style sound effects), but still have a limited set of 8 of their own channels to work with.    thanks for checking out the project so far. i've been working hard on this project and learning a lot as i work on it. without a doubt, it's the largest game project i've worked on to date, and i've approached a lot of concepts that are new to me, despite playing with Clickteam tools for so many years. i suppose that's the result of diving into the deep end of something which has only been a passing hobby until now. it's a lot of fun, anyways, and i hope you can have fun with it too. i know it's not for everybody, but i still love to hear how it makes people feel.  as i mentioned, i still have a lot to learn, so please, if you could: report bugs to me on Twitter  @MuleNgine ! you can also email  darius@halleylabs.associates . this early alpha still has a lot of issues (it was built last year), and ends after the first stage, once you arrive at the stage select. you just have to quit manually at that point.",Action||Platformer,clickteam||Difficult||fusion||hybrid||mashup||Shoot 'Em Up||sprite-effects||stg,悪魔の悪夢: AR EK-QUA ER SETA,mulengine.itch.io/ana

"A neatly fenced-off, densely interactive piece of the Universe to potter about in.     A Piece Of The Universe is a sense-of-place experiment built entirely in Google Blocks and Unity, made In VR, for VR. It grew out of a mere inkling of an idea about a place, and has been forming itself out of thin air ever since that first bit of kitchen I built in what was supposed to be my vacation in June 2017.  It's a small place with super-high interactive density, filled with little experiments with the medium, and slowly but surely a narrative is beginning to form.   More information in the devlog of the latest release .   Follow me on Twitter  to keep up to date to what I'm working on for the next update!  Also, so chuffed,  APOTU was featured on Engadget !     (here's a Steam-grid conform image for those that need it)    CURRENT VERSION: 0.72b2  - Quick fix: there's glints in the world that indicate you have something new to type about. They didn't always appear. Fixed that.  0.72b1  - I'm ditching the Oculus-only build – there is no (graphical) difference anymore between SteamVR and Oculus (used to be that Oculus looked slightly better).  Let me know if you want an Oculus version anyway, it's not much of a problem!  - A new Piece Of The Universe to find and wander about in! See if you can find the (wet) entry to it yourself!  - An inventory system! Pull your coat open from below your chin and stuff objects in it.   - telekinetics! For those hard to reach objects, grab the air and make circling motions in the direction of said object!  - a narrative system! Elements in the world may give you a flash of inspiration – type your thoughts out on the typewriter when they do!  - tightened up the teleporting system.  - adjusted the Rig room (where you first enter APOTU). Revisit it by pulling the plug when you enter the game!   v0.65b2  New stuff: the teleport glasses, the tropical shower, lots of under-the-hood stuff, and a basic form of Sound Occlusion.  b2 is Oculus only, and shoudl fix a calibration issue some users had at the start of the game.",,diorama||Virtual Reality (VR),A Piece Of The Universe [prototype],naam.itch.io/apotu

Got a date with the Cthulu Dating App  Who knew it had drawbacks?  Do you know what she wore for work that day?

This problem may come in the form of locked state in which the game’s ending is supposed to trigger. I had to waste 6 hours trying to fix the problem on WebGL side of things whereas the WIN version had no problems whatsoever. I did my best to make the WebGL work but unfortunately I had to ‘sacrifice’ my time to develop other parts of the game.  For those looking for the best game experience please download the game from the link below. I had made the WebGL for convenience sake and it was my first time too so it didn’t really work out in the end.,Visual Novel||Strategy,Dating Sim||Ludum Dare 43||Text based||typing,Typeless,naihtou.itch.io/typeless
"Hi, everyone!  We are still working hard on  A Very Important Date .  Due to some serious health issues for a few members, things have been slowly progressing in some departments. In the character section down below we've added the updated sprites for the main characters, except for Alison as we're still working on her.  These sprites aren't in the demo yet.   We plan to update the demo between December and January and, of course, hope for sooner.  The next demo will have our new sprites and a whole bunch of new features. We do update our  Facebook ,  Twitter , and  Tumblr  more than here, so if you want to keep up-to-date on what's going on, you can follow us there.  A Very Important Date  is a café romance set in a strange, yet familiar world, with loose ties to Lewis Carroll's Alice stories. But this isn't the typical Alice in Wonderland styled story! While A Very Important Date takes a few notes from the Carroll classics, you don't have to be a big fan of them to enjoy this game for its rich dialogue, witty humor, and unique art style!  	Our story follows Alison Sunderlund, an average small town Ohio girl. By day she can be found working as a server in a local café and by night she takes care of her house and family: her dad and younger brother. Though she doesn't have a lot on her plate, the life she has gives her very little free time. But Alison's life changes one morning when she wakes up sitting under a tree in a brand new world.  	Confused, Alison sets out to discover more about her new surroundings, accidentally stumbling upon the Arkwright estate, home of Gwyn Arkwright and The Looking Glass Café. With no place to go and a way back home seeming impossible, Gwyn, being the kind soul that he is, gives Alison a job and a place to stay for the time being. Everything's peachy except... now Alison must choose which of The Looking Glass' five employees will train her!  	Will Alison stick with what she knows and remain a server? Will she a cut a new path as a cook's assistant? Will she wipe away her past burdens as a low-level dishwasher? Will Alison ever figure out what strange world she's in? Will she ever return to her old life?  	Will she want to?   	  	All storiesare written by Noëlle Hyzy, the winner of Voltage Inc.'s 4th Annual International Script Writing Contest for Romance Apps.  	 8 suitors 	 Expressive animated characters 	 12 chapters for each Suitor's Main Story 	 3 possible endings per Main Story 	 3 chapter Epilogues for each Suitor 	 40+ hours of content across all stories 	 ≈50,000 words per Main Story 	 300,000+ words across the whole game 	 At least 6 CGs per Main Story 	 Main character CG options 	 12 amazing tracks from Composer Geoff Moore 	 60+ beautiful backgrounds 	 Episodic content 	 Available for Windows, Mac, and Linux 	 Available for iOS and Android.       	This demo consists of our game's prologue, where we introduce Alison, build the wondrous town of Mimsboro, and give players a glimpse of the Looking Glass crew.  	To pull up the in-game menu outside of the main menu, press P or ESC.  	 Note:  some programs render the ESC key inoperable when running in conjunction with other programs, this demo included.

Our goal is to make stories that all of you wonderful people want to read. We hope to shake-up the visual novel market with more westernized stories, while still retaining the beautiful anime inspired art of the otome genre's roots.  	 A Very Important Date  started as Noelle's passion project in June 2014.  She'd grown to love visual novels and the otome genre and felt that it was time to tell one of her own stories.  But ambition took over, and the Important Date lore grew to the epic story that it is now.  So to help reign in the project, Noelle found other like-minded individuals along the way to make sure that this big game got made.

"DEVIL'S FLOWER is a small story-driven 2D first-person dungeon crawl style game.  Search for the all-important DEVIL'S FLOWER and meet a handful of characters along the way!  As you travel the halls of the large tower that DEVIL'S FLOWER takes place inside, your vitality will slowly drain. If you die, that's it! However, there are a few ways to make sure your vitality stays above zero. Some of them are a little unreliable, however...  The story unfolds as you talk to characters, who might move around and change depending upon your interactions with them! There are three endings and maybe a few secrets, too!  WARNING:   This game is really dialogue-heavy. If you don't want to read that much, maybe it would be a good idea not to play DEVIL'S FLOWER. DEVIL'S FLOWER is meant to be played in a single sitting! Although there is a pause function, exiting to the main menu will reset the game. Dying will reset the game. Maybe there will be some bugs. I'm sorry if you find one that ruins your experience, but I will no longer provide support or updates for this game. Please forgive me if something glitchy happens.

"[UPDATE:  Circumstances have provided our team the opportunity to remake this game to bring it to its full potential, so I've relabelled this a prototype, as that's very much how it'll look compared to the final version. We'll keep you posted. ]  Disorient On The Murder Express is a short, humorous and experimental murder mystery game in which you are tasked with deducing the details of a convoluted murder that took place on an isolated train, and making a show of presenting the evidence and accusing the culpable parties.  The game was born from a Game Jam hosted by GamesDev Wales in association with the Agatha Christie estate. The theme was Murder Mystery, and it was the first Game Jam I'd ever worked on without a team. Basic versions of Act I and Act II were made in the allocated 48 hours, and Act III was conceptualised. The complicated nature of Act III made it impossible to even start during that time, so the story's set-up, presentation and mystery itself were the development focus during the Jam. It was important to me that the game contain all the components of the msytery for the player to solve, so I could focus on the mechanics of expressing those conclusions later. The game was completed over the two weeks following the Game Jam.  This was almost entirely the work of myself, Gary Kings. I am not a 3D artist, hence leaning into a simplistic (and hopefully, endearing) art style, and making use of the default Unreal skeletal Mesh in various poses in the game. I am also not much of a programmer, so be sure to report any bugs to me (and spelling errors). What I am primarily is a narrative designer, writer and director, and my aim with this game was to create a murder mystery focusing on deduction and the theatrics of expressing your findings. I hope you enjoy and support my future work with National Insecurities.  Thank you.  Gary Kings. Follow us on Twitter at @GaryJKings and @NIPresents Note: While the Game Jam itself was in association with the Agatha Christie estate, the game is not. Any similarities between this game and Christie's iconic works are meant as loving homage or loving parody.  MAC NOTE: I haven't tested the Mac build very much, and I wouldn't recommend it unless you're on fairly new mac with actual graphics hardware (Nvidia or whatever). Install instructions The game should, in theory, run on any capable windows computer straight after unzipping the file. I'm not sure what the bounds of 'capable computer' are in relation to this game, as I don't have the means for widespread testing, so if it runs particularly badly for you, I'd appreciate hearing your specifications.  I hope to release a Linux and Mac version soon, so feel free to pester me a little to speed me up if you're particularly interested.

"The Ritual  is a short top-down horror game. The Story Every few years, in the face of poor harvests, pestilence, or mysterious disappearances, the villagers in this remote country must make a sacrifice to restore balance and prevent the destruction of their society. The entity to which they make this offering has been called many things: monster, demon, or beast. The villagers do not know the true name or origins of the beast, nor do they care to. They know enough: if allowed to slake its thirst for the blood of the innocents, it will spare them and perhaps even favor them with a bountiful harvest in the fall. The children to be sacrificed are left deep in the woods, or sometimes on an island nearby. Sometimes they are drugged, sometimes they are bound, sometimes they simply accept their grim fate. An elder of the village draws a symbol in the dirt and chants strange words into the night sky. Once finished, the elder departs quickly, lest the beast devour him or her along with its quarry. The beast hunts the child sacrifices. Sometimes it glides silently through the air, sometimes it sprints along the ground like an animal. No child left to the monster in this way has ever returned to the village. This year, you are among those to be sacrificed. You don't know if this monster can be hurt, let alone killed. You're sure that if you run far enough and fast enough that you can survive the night without being caught and devoured.

"What is it?  Visiting the virtual  Museum of Parallel Art  is a very special experience you will share with someone. Get a friend or a stranger, a controller and have a nice relaxing time in our little museum.  You'll express your thoughts and feelings towards art with cards, or try to view the world as your peer and guess the cards he or she has played. Comparing cards will prompt conversation and is sure to connect you two.  This game was originally made in 48 hours by  Neverpants  (Dom2D, technobeanie & seventysevian), featuring art both classic and new, with contributions by many amazing artists like Anthony Clark, Justin Chan, Nic ter Horst, Tom Eccles, Aliceffekt and way more! We've spent a little bit of time polishing it and adding art and cards since.  Randomly generated from a database of over 200 “paintings"" and a multitude of cards, the  Museum of Parallel Art  is different every time you visit. For more information check out our blog at neverpants.com!

"Play the latest WebGL build on  Poki  (supported by ads)  Description  Irrational Karate is a fighting game for people that like the idea of beat em ups but were never really good enough to play them. It's a game for people that enjoy mercilessly thumping their enemies but wished it could all look cuter. Mostly, though, it's a game originally created for  Bitgem's 9th Game Jam .  Despite the game jam being over  (and  Irrational Karate  placing  1st  - wooh!) , my work on this game is not. Having teamed up with the talented guys at  Bitgem , we're looking to continue development and expand the content, clean up any remaining rough edges, and release on more platforms. I'll keep the dev log posted with updates as they happen and will upload new builds as and when sensible milestones are reached.  Irrational Karate is currently free on itch (genuinely free - no ads, and please feel free to share it with people), but any donations are incredibly welcome as they'll directly help fund further development on this and other current and future projects.  P.S. Oh, and the web version should be fine, but I'd definitely recommend the download version for quality/stability etc.  Controls   Xbox Controller (recommended)    Left Thumbstick  - Move left/right, jump, crouch  A  - Kick/OK  B  - Back  X  - Quick Attack  Y  - Heavy Attack  START  - Pause/Back     Keyboard    Arrow Keys  - Move left/right, jump, crouch  S  - Kick  A  - Quick Attack  W  - Heavy Attack  ESC  - Pause/Back  RETURN  - OK",Fighting,Beat 'em up||Cute||Local multiplayer||Singleplayer,Irrational Karate,neverreststudio.itch.io/irrational-karate

I can't provide any precise release date since the game is in development.  PLATFORM  The game will be on Steam (Windows x64).  For other platforms, it will come after the Steam release.

"In No Hacker's Sky you're a space enthusiast, who also happens to be a skilled  hacker . It's set in the future, where a huge space mining corporation called Extrasolar Mining Corp (EMC) has deployed probes, satellites and manned stations on distant planets and moons. You are contacted by a group called Unknown to hack into the EMC network to find out what is going on.  Here's where the game begins. You use the in-game command prompt together with the ""node map"" to hack into EMC's network. You start by poking for weaknesses, exploring the network for emails and passwords, eventually gaining access to offworld drones. Look for evidence in documents and emails, and while using their drones you can look for signs of what they have been hiding.   To access nodes you either have to provide certain password files, or clear 3D visualized puzzle worlds (19 of them). You'll even get to explore a couple of planets near the end of the game (screenshot 4 is one of them).   Review  "" In No Hacker's Sky you play a skilled computer hacker who is attempting to uncover an interplanetary conspiracy using a mixture of basic command line prompts and first person puzzle solving.  ...  With it's intriguing storyline, clever use of interfaces and unique hacking-based puzzle design, No Hacker's Sky is a joy to play. A well crafted hacking sim, full of discovery, unique gameplay and innovation. ""  -  Calum Fraser ( FGP )   Instructions  To open nodes, you must first open the node map by writing in the command ""toggle nodemap"". What you see then is the main node map, with different network nodes. These network nodes hold a sub node map, where the nodes are essentially individual systems.  To open network nodes, click on them. The network nodes with a ""?"" on them aren't accessible, so you can't open them - however, the system nodes with a ""?"" on them can be opened (which is very essential), and then hacked by either password or a node world. You can move the node map around my dragging it around. To go back to the main node map that shows network nodes, just click the little ""Back"" button.  Main Command Prompt  Enter : Call commands (if the input field isn't already focused, this will focus it). TAB : This scrolls through commands, including their arguments. If you write a bit of a command and press TAB, it will try to find one that matches (even if you just write a bit of an argument). Holding Shift while pressing TAB will go the opposite direction, this means you can go back if you accidentally scroll past the command you want to call. Arrow Key Up + Down : This scrolls through previously called commands. You can move and resize windows in the same way you would with a normal operating system. To use tools, drag them to the other pane in the file window. To avoid confusion about using tools, click  here  to see how to use them.  To use passwords, you have to drag them to the little area saying ""Password Required"".    Planets + Node Worlds  WASD : Movement. Shift : Run. Spacebar : Jump. (Planets) Escape : Open command line that'll let you write ""exit"" to exit planet. (Node Worlds) To unfocus a terminal, either look away or press Escape. (Node Worlds) Type in ""exit"" in any terminal (there may be some exceptions) to leave the node world. (Node Worlds) The ""Home"" key restarts the level.   Known issues  Sometimes needing to push 'T' multiple times on a drone to log an evidence piece. In falling puzzles, you can sometimes stick to the wall to stop falling. In falling puzzles, sticking to the wall sometimes propels you into the air. If you hit a corner in the right way in a maze or drone - it flings you into the air. Press home to reset in the maze when you are flung upwards.   Hints/Tips  Tools cannot be used if the node hasn't been hacked/unlocked.  Hint: You can click on email notifications to open the new email.  Hint 2: If you seem to be stuck - remember to use the Hound tool frequently. It will show hidden places and also reveal traps. Rogue can only be used on known tripwires.  Hint 3: There are only three viruses but many more honeypots. Use them wisely.  Hint 4: 'help' to get commands and see how many proxies (lives) you have left.  Hint 5: If you're stuck after the first four nodes, please remember to read the emails. Use Hound on the node ""Hub"" and the hidden node will be shown. When you reach the end node in that network, click the ""Back"" button on the node map to go back to the main node map.  Hint 6: Please read emails carefully, sometimes you get important info from them (especially in the first node network).  Hint 7: To use tools on nodes, you need to have access to them.   Hint 8: Keep in mind you can drag the windows around, as well as resize them (just like you would in Windows, OS X or Linux).  If you are careful you will finish the game, if you are careless you will perish.

"Welcome back, Princesses!  It's your second year in St. Goals and you've all done a remarkable job last year. In fact, some of you managed more than ten Villaintines, a grand feat! I hope you all have the same performance this year too!    Now, before we start this year and I let you go to your assigned Villaintines, let's all state the Princess Code:  I, state your name, would uphold the school's mission to clear the world of evil. By giving love to those scorned and turning those monsters into angels. I will be a representative of Peace, Love, and Tranquility...  The Princess knew the code by heart. She is one of the many in St. Goals who wants to help turn a Villain's life around by showing them that someone out there can try to understand them. That there's someone who just wants to be their friend and show them love.  Also, she failed last year's assignment so this year might just be her chance to achieve something... in apparently, just  five  days.  In which she finds out that everything is just based on stereotypes and her beliefs are not exactly as good as she thinks it is.     Stereotypes: the Villains and Princesses' edition One Ending but with two variations  Choices that don't heavily influence the story, they are there for a variety of responses.  it only matters if you want to be possible lovers in the future.   Story-oriented Extras section!  Playable in Windows, Mac, and Linux Cute Character Sprites (?) Sob stories (?) Monochrome Backgrounds A protagonist who tells bad jokes and pick-up lines A tsundere side character A dog who hates your very presence A fanboy who asks for signatures in lanterns And many more...   The Princess  ( alias-able: instead of a name, you give her an alias! )  ' Don't worry, I'll make your life colorful if you let me .'  A cheerful girl who thinks a lot. After failing last year, and being nagged by her Father day in day out, she  wanted to do her best this year.   Attributes:  can sometimes call herself 'The Princess of Bad Timings' tells  bad  jokes and pick-up lines cheerful  but might lowkey self-depreciate  The Villain  ( his name can appear early in the game or at the end )  ' It seems unable to take a hint .'  The Princess' assigned Villaintine for the year. He might seem villainy in the overall atmosphere of his home, the Princess is still uncertain what exactly makes him a villain.  Attributes:  passive refers to everything as 'It' stuck in the emo phase you can probably steal from his house   Credits  For credits, the full list is in the game's folder.  Sidenotes:  This is a submission for  FFS Jam 2018 , wherein I finally achieved something :D Please don't use the rollback feature too much at the moment. I'm referring to being able to go back by scrolling up with your mouse because something magical will happen (jk, just the quick menu disappearing). It's not something I can fix (I'll see what I can do next time) so just please don't use it too much or even at all. As an alternative, you can just click on the 'Back' or save at a menu choice.  If you find any other bug aside from the quick menu issue, please email me at  niannn08@gmail.com  with a screenshot of said bug. Enjoy!  Here's Mr. Couture's article about the game:  http://www.siliconera.com/2018/01/25/princess-shows-bad-guy-love-villaintine/ I also post some TV-art in my  twitter  so you can go visit me there.

It's just one word, nothing crucial. So yeah, minimal update. 28/01/2018  - I finished proofreading and transferring it to rpy files so the VN should be okay now, grammar-wise :D (I managed to fit it through the schedule, lol.

"This project is based on the poem 'The Cremation of Sam McGee' by Robert W. Service (1907). The art style is heavily derived from the work of Ted Harrison, and his collection of paintings which share the poem's namesake. The narration is derived from a reading by Johnny Cash on the NPR from 2006 (while the delivery has some errors, it's by far my favourite reading of the text). This is not a game, but rather a narrative experience to engage with one of my favourite pieces of poetry. It only takes a few minutes to finish, perhaps only a couple more than listening to a reading of the source text. It was proudly developed in the Unreal 4 Engine, and primarily features assets collected from Epic Game's various package releases. All audio is retooled from freesound.org, and the music track is an altered version of KatMaestro and dem0lecule's 'Frozen River' from NewGrounds. This project can be used freely for educational purposes, but cannot be redistributed for profit in any way. Controls: Movement - WASD/Joystick Interact - E/Left Face Button Pause - ESC/Start Thanks for playing!

All the support and humour I've seen from Itch users like you is inspiring me to really dive into this project. Don't hesitate to reach out and ask questions and give feedback!  Also  JOIN MY DISCORD!!  I post screenshots and gifs every few hours of development. It's a great place to get in touch, ask questions, share your own work with me, and chat about whatever!  -  papa™  ⁉ FAQ ⁉   Q: No! What the fuck? Why do they have arms?  And thank YOU for joining me today! Please do not swear in front of my birds as they may learn your filth.  Q: This game looks horrifying, why should I not leave immediately?  Bird by Example is — and I say this with great passion:   ""A mock RPG where all the other occupants are horrifying birds who mimic your behaviour with deep learning.""  It's just like Skyrim but without all those frightening ghouls! In fact, I'll let you in on a little secret... This game IS Skyrim! That's right! I worked on the first version of Skyrim, and it was this! Long before Bethesda was usurped by those fear mongering high-fantasy suits.  Q: Shit... I do like Skyrim...  Yes you do! And it will be just like that! But there will be nothing to be afraid of! In bird world there is nothing to be afraid of! Nothing to be afraid of!  Right now at this very second, the metaphysical bounds of this game hold a throng of hungry birds who wish nothing more than to be like you! Like mama!  These birds have artificial brains that optimize learning challenges using trendy Deep Learning algorithms found in the titular deep and ancient waters directly adjacent to the Silicon Valley.   You will be helping  mama™  teach the rest of the birds basic skills which they can apply using their rudimentary environmental awareness and a knack for peer-to-peer teaching to develop a new world order. A world free from Big Ghoul!  Q: Nothing you just said sounds like Skyrim! None of this even sounds like a game!?  Well you're still here. Thaaaaat's capitalism!  Q: No it's not! This game is free!  And it's called the  free  market! Please settle down.  Q: Ok, so the birds learn? What do they learn?  The birds always learn from their  mama™  (you), so you can always try to teach them new things! This will be important for getting them started, as initially their brains are random and ill-equipped for living in this bird-world.  However, birds also learn from each other! This means you can teach one bird, and that bird will teach their friends! (This is important for the game). But this is a double edged sword as it suffers from the issue that —  shitty  birds will teach  better  birds to be  shittier .  Q: Shitty birds?   I  can only assume you are as distressed as I am about shitty birds.  So my solution is that I will be implementing a system for on-the-fly success metrics that you (their mother) can set from your town hall! You can design your own success metric and see how it affects your median population. This is important for the game.  Maybe you try out communism (labour = good), or capitalism (personal wealth = good), or a warrior society (mortal combat = good), or a dictatorship (pampering you = good)! The options will be limitless.  Based on the regime you choose, it will rank birds' effectiveness within this regime, and the most successful ~20% of birds within the current regime will be considered 'teachers', and will pass on their knowledge to the youngsters.  Q: But what is a bird?   A bird is a fictional creature which came to me in a dream last February during an especially cold night. I fear they might be inspired (subconsciously) by both a small subset of lizards, and the darker, distrustful side of us humans.  Q: Can the birds die?  No. Next question.  Q: Will the birds be able to die one day?  Okay you caught me — yes — birds will be able to die, but only from violent deaths. They do not age in the conventional sense. This is important for the game.  Amendment: Starvation is also on the table.  Q: Concerning. What's your goal for this project?  I want more than anything for Bird by Example to be a storytelling engine. I want to develop flexible dynamic systems and hope that emergent play... emerges from the interplay between the AIs and (importantly) you, the player.  Q: You were talking a lot about capitalism up there. Are you a conservative?  No! And how  dare  you!  Q: Umm, I know a little bit about machine learning and I have some questions...  Each bird uses a deep (6 hidden layers)  Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)  with ~30 inputs and ~10 outputs. I chose a recurrent neural network because they are most handy for working with sequenced inputs. The sequence these birds use is time. They currently run back-propagation every 0.1 seconds and currently have no preference for 'what' they are learning.  They also 'read' about 20 categories of metadata about objects they see in the environment, including but not limited to:  Does this object evoke DEATH 💀? Does this object evoke THE UNKNOWN👽? Does this object evoke POWER🤑? Does this object evoke COWARDICE😨? Does this object evoke CURIOSITY🧐?  And these evocations inform the transferal of skills between objects of similar category! Amazing! Teach a bird to eat a JUICY pineapple 🍍, and if they see another juicy lookin' thing (orange 🍊, snail 🐌, another bird 🦆) they'll probably choose to eat that too !  Q: Cool, this is scary! (?)  Thank you! Yes, it is.   Q: Can I play this game?  Yes! Please do!

"Ever downward we go!  Originally written for the  #gbjam  (GameBoy Jam 4)! Ever Downward  is a light-hearted roguelike inspired by the look and feel of the early Zelda series, and the semi-turn-based combat system of Parasite Eve.

To play the original jam version check out its  Game Jolt page .) Descend deeper and deeper into the  Underground Facility  and fight through all sorts of nasties.

"-'How does it go, again?'  -'The Knight fell from the Spire, and then died. The End.'  Good Night, Knight  is a dynamic sneak-and-slash RPG that mixes procedural generation with hand-made puzzles and story! Featuring heavy-hitting deliberate combat, robust stealth mechanics, a huge selection of versatile items, and unique threatening enemies to face!   KEY FEATURES:  Strategic heavy-hitting combat:  Skill, timing, and good positioning are key to your survival. Robust stealth elements:  Sneak, peek around corners, with the help of the dynamic field-of-view system and learn where enemies are patrolling to catch them off-guard.

Huge amounts of loot to find and equip:  Mix and match gear, potions, and curses to find your preferred playstyle. Risk/Reward management:  Choose between retreating to rest or venturing onwards for extra rewards. Extra challenges:  Enable many different extra challenge modifiers for even more rewards, but don't get too greedy! Prepare yourself for battle:  Food, ingredients, and provisions help you stay in top shape during battles. Gather resources during combat, and manage how much to spend during preparations. No permadeath:  Progress is saved while advancing through the campaign. And just like real life, death can still be very costly. Optional Ironman mode:  In this game mode, if you die, everything is lost! Only for the toughest Knights! Dog petting:  Pet a dog.

Made for the Daydream bitsy jam. Plays best in Chrome. And there are some bird sounds to enjoy - played on the cornet!  When I work with sound I often make things that are very harsh and difficult to listen too. When I work with visuals and short bits of text I often end up making things that are more like lullabies. In this case the game is a lullaby and the sound that goes with it is the honking of birds in flight .. a strange type of pixel-goose perhaps?,Adventure,Bitsy||Lo-fi,Levitation in Bitsy,noiseart.itch.io/levitation-in-bitsy

"Social Justice Warriors  is a satirical role-playing game that translates the standard medieval fantasy heroes of role-playing games into social media crusaders facing an endless horde of ignorant internet trolls. Social Justice Warriors Trailer Social Justice Paladins  duel foes with 140 characters or less while shrugging off attacks with a press of the Block button. Social Justice Clerics  serve in the name of their patron sub-deity, summoning its divine power to smite their enemies.  Social Justice Mages  conjure powerful constructs of fact and opinion to alter minds and reality... while occasionally hurling a scathing fireball of a blog post.  Social Justice Rogues  fight fire with fire. Throw flurries of vitriolic character attacks then delete your accounts and withdraw into the shadows of the net. Social Justice Warriors is a game about the dismissive labels people use to silence each other, including ""social justice warrior"" and ""troll"". No matter what social values you have, attacking and ridiculing other people not only fails to achieve progress but has an additional effect of escalating the conflict and wearing you down in the process.

"Electric Rogue  is a minimal first-person roguelike with 2.5D graphics and an abstract cyberpunk theme. There are 10 levels, that can be completed in half an hour. The user interface is made for touchscreen devices, and scales to any screen size, though it's best viewed in 854x480 or so.  How to play  On each level, retrieve the three keycards and bump into the corresponding terminals to activate them. When you're done, return to the transfer pad to continue. Don't waste moves! Once you're out of cycles, your noise starts growing. You can only tolerate up to 100 times the level you're on.  On each level you're going to run into viruses that have infected the system. Bump into them to fight; they're extra vulnerable when their lights are off. Overall, avoid them if you can. A useful tactical move is pressing the [X] button (or the spacebar) to wait a turn.  Last but not least, every time you pick up a keycard, for the next 15 moves or so you can chase down and kill viruses with impunity. But don't go out of your way to do it unless you can spare the CPU cycles!  Keys  If you have a keyboard, the following work:     WASD or the arrow keys for movement;    Enter for the [O] (circle) button;    Space for the [X] (cross) button.    Escape for the menu button.  At the title screen, press left/right or up/down to toggle the credits. During the game, the circle button toggles a statistics pane.

"NEW, FULLY POLISHED DEMO!   As longtime aficionados of both visual novels and romcom anime we've spent the past few years pouring our heart and soul into Pipe Dream, a slice-of-life dating sim that follows Robin as she explores college life and escapes her mother's shadow. Unlike many other dating sims we wanted to create a game that doesn't just end when the characters get together, but also explores the complexities of how the relationship develops afterwards.   We have a cast of six charming characters for the player to romance, but be careful! Not everyone has Robin's best interests at heart.    Gary  (CV. Lucas Gilbertson) ーA happy-go-lucky guy with no personal space bubble. Studying to be a forensic scientist. Intelligent, emotional, and occasionally overwhelming.   Elliot  (CV. Brett Bauer) ーA quiet, grumpy guy studying to be a vet. Wants to be cool, but his streak of bad luck and lack of chill always end up sabotaging him.    Avalon  (CV. Carol Anne Day) ーRobin's best friend since high school and current roomie. Energetic, independent, and meddlesome. A ride or die friend.   Akio  (CV. Belsheber Rusape) ーA naive, arrogant rich kid who cut ties with his family to pursue his passion for art. Huffy, dramatic, and hates being incapable.   Cain  (CV. Tom Aglio) ーA perpetually tired charmer juggling part-time jobs to provide for his younger sibling, his only present family. Slowly chipping away at his business degree.    John  (CV. Griffin Puatu) ーA sporty, well-liked guy that somehow slips everyone's mind.

"""But I love you."" is a visual novel/dating sim...or at least, it starts off that way. Once you get in town, the occupants all flock to you, intrigued by the stranded newcomer. At first, they try to help in their own little ways, but as they grow attached, they try to convince you to stay with them. Forever. That's when you notice things are very, very wrong in this town, from the datable characters to the setting. Once the player starts to notice a trend of the girls starting to be slightly, well, nuts, it becomes a horror game. The game still features multiple endings like a dating sim, some of them romantic, some where nothing happens, and a few where the player is...dead. You also have the option of ignoring all of the bad stuff and pretending everything is a-ok to keep scoring with the ladies.

WATCH LESS ANIME THIS TIME.  Four Horsemen is a visual novel / SLG about homelands and the immigrant experience. Play as a group of four contemporary immigrant teenagers squatting in a World War II era machine gun bunker, trying to find a place for themselves in a pre-apocalyptic, present-dystopian country that has no place for them. Will you go native, turning against your own people to bury the past your parents fled to escape? Will you cling to your parents' identity at any cost, at the price of being a permanent stranger in your home country? Or will you strike out on your own, turning against both your homelands to shape a destiny for yourself? Love is all you need...and also improvised firearms.  Drawing from the developers' own lived experiences, interviews with current and former immigrant teens from around the world, and a year of painstaking anthropological research, featuring  4 different main storylines,   9 different endings, 12 different playable homelands  (all of which play differently), and a multitude of agonizing, important decisions, Four Horsemen is the most heartwarmingly familiar, brutally honest video game about the immigrant experience ever created. One playthrough can be finished in a matter of hours, but you'll want to revisit it again and again to see all of the many stories the game has to tell...and to pursue that elusive dream of a land you can call your own.  Exciting Bullet Points!!  YOUR DECISIONS MATTER.  Hard choices you make at the beginning come back to haunt you at the end. Characters turn out to be heroic or villainous depending on how you treat them--and they don't always reward you for treating them well. NO TWO COUNTRIES PLAY ALIKE.  Each homeland has its own unique vocabulary, set of cultural values, prejudices, and history. Choices that are a good idea in one country turn out to be a reaaaaally bad idea in another. Like a real immigrant, you'll have to read your new culture and learn to adapt. NOT JUST BLACK AND WHITE.  No faction reputation system! No alignment meter! Four Horsemen offers realistic, genuinely difficult moral choices, and to some questions there are no right answers--only different consequences. DELIGHTFUL CRAFTING SYSTEM.  Make that cold, austere war bunker feel like home--dive into dumpsters scrounging for parts, or buy them with your earnings from your terrible day job, and make reasonable DIY facsimiles of things you can't afford! Characters interact with things you build. Make a disco ball and they'll throw a dance party, patch up that hole in the roof and they'll enjoy a quiet moment together on a rainy day. But beware--the system is not exactly fair to immigrants... TRIUMPH OVER HATE.  A bigot pulls a knife on you--what do you do? Do you try to de-escalate the situation with words...or respond by drawing your own blade? Our combat system replicates the anxiety and tension of real violence, not a power fantasy.

"Play as  Doctor  Simon Forman - unlicensed medical professional and astrologer - and help him win a medical licence. Astrologaster is a narrative-based comedy game.  Explore Forman’s life, his work, and his relationships with his clients. Make story choices by performing astrological readings. Choose strategically or make decisions just for fun - but be aware that your choices will have consequences (and unpredictable side effects!) 13 clients come to see you 5-7 times seeking advice for personal, professional and medical problems. By examining the stars in the sky, you diagnose and determine answers for your clients’ problems. As well as affecting the storyline, these choices will alter your clients’ satisfaction levels. Satisfied clients will write you letters of recommendation, and with enough of these letters you can obtain a medical licence from the University of Cambridge.   So-called  real  (licensed) doctors call Forman a quack and fraud. Help Forman prove these medical establishment elitists wrong!  Features  Perform real* astrology:  Examine the sky and choose astrological interpretations that Forman will use to advise his patients. (But remember: astrology is not an exact science!) Solve hilarious problems:  Consult on problems ranging from Elizabethan terror plots and foul diseases, to romantic entanglements and stolen pies! Change lives:  Win your patients’ favour or ruin their lives. Advise 14 characters who return 5-7 times. Patients have their own ongoing stories which often overlap with each other. Use gossip from some characters to guide and manipulate others.  Win a medical licence:  Convince patients to write letters of recommendations. Collect enough letters to exchange them for a medical licence. Fully voiced character dialogue:  Sitcom-style comedy brought to life by a cast of over a dozen actors. Sing along:  Enjoy Renaissance-era music and sing along to each character’s theme song. Casebooks come alive:  Simon Forman’s cases are presented as a beautiful pop-up book.

"Experience a terrifying  #asylumjam2017  winning submission, created in only 48 hours.  During World War 2, Japan had an urgent need for many schools. Rumour has it that the government built the schools on cheap land such as graveyards, which quickly became the talk of the town in many prefectures.  Witness one such school which is home to the Tenome, a Japanese yokai with eyes on its palms and feeds on the fresh bones of humans. See through the eyes of Tanaka; a bullied, asthmatic student who has been locked inside of the school at night.  Tenome is inspired by Hideyuki Hirayama's Gakkō no Kaidan.

"Event[0]  is an award-winning narrative exploration game where you must build a relationship with a lonely spaceship computer to get home. Set in a retrofuture inspired by sci-fi classics such as  2001: A Space Odyssey , the game is about forging a personal relationship with your only companion, an insecure AI entity capable of procedurally generating over two million lines of dialog. You interact with the computer, named Kaizen, by typing messages on terminals throughout the ship. The reality of your situation will emerge organically as you communicate with Kaizen and explore the mysterious ship in first-person perspective. 	 	You'll freely navigate evocative 3D environments brought to life with physics-based rendering and advanced lighting techniques. You'll examine items to gather information and solve hacking puzzles as you progress. You can even leave the ship for breathtakingly scary spacewalks! All sound and music come from the environment; there is no traditional score. The ship is essentially the AI computer's body, and reacts to Kaizen's feelings by making different sounds—pay attention for clues!	 	 	As in any relationship, there can be gratitude, disappointment, or jealousy, and Kaizen reacts differently depending on its mood. By working through the fears and anxieties of your virtual companion, you can eventually find your way back to Earth—while unraveling the cryptic history of the ship and the 1980s society from which it emerged.",Adventure,3D||artificial-intelligence||Atmospheric||FPS||Futuristic||Sci-fi||Space||Spooky||Text based,Event[0],ocelotsociety.itch.io/event0

"A Fast-Paced, First Person Dungeon Crawler Game  Doomgeon  is a retro pixel art game about staying alive while descending to the bottom of an overrun dungeon. The player will be thrown against a wide variety of mobs, each with their own unique abilities.  The concept is simple: explore, fight and collect as much loot as you can along the way!  Because the game is still in the  early stages  of development, there's quite a bit of content to be added. Likewise, there are definitely bugs to be discovered and any and all features are subject to change.  And while several aspects of the design are still being ironed out, the core gameplay mechanics are  rock solid . We strive for incremental improvements in each build and zero bugs!   Features we have in place so far:  Explore a randomly generated dungeon.   Fight a variety of mob types.   Collect gold as you travel deeper into the dungeon.   Quaff potions to stay alive and use special abilities!  Features on the horizon:  Hero stats and leveling system.   Player inventory system.   Additional Hero types (Hunter, Mage).

"Lurking is a classic RPG inspired by Ultima III.   Classless character creation with modifiable skills. Build a party of up to five characters. Huge (300x300 tile) open world to be explored with nonlinear story progression. Beautiful retro pixel scenery that changes with the seasons. Additional gigantic multi-level underworld with separate town and battle maps. Turn-based combat in the U3 style. Hundreds of weapons, armor, and special items. Dozens of magical spells and songs. Day/Night cycle and scenery that changes with the season. 40+ hours of game play. A fantasy role playing experience reminiscent of Ultima III, Wizardy, and The Bard's Tale.  TRAILER LINK:  https://youtu.be/t6dx2SVocWM    PLOT :  A mysterious figure has resurrected three ancient kings of realms from their long, cold slumbers within their barrows. The barrow wights have taken up residence in the ruins of their former keeps and unleashed legions of undead to wreck havoc upon the lands. The denizens of the land have also become emboldened by the growing shadow of evil and despair. In desperation, the Lord Deciper has issued forth a calling for heroes to come to the aid of the people, and to find a way to thrust back the growing darkness and return the barrow wights to their slumber.     Lurking I: Immortui  boasts a huge open world role-playing experience with massive exploration, hundreds of NPCs to converse with, hordes of bloodthirsty foes, dozens of secrets, puzzles, and piles of weapons, armor, special items (and other loot). Develop your characters by chasing the skills you desire for them as they gain  experience and level up. Play magical bard songs, cast magical spells,  and unravel the mystery of the resurrected barrow wights. No one will guide you through each step. No one will come to your aid in the wild. Accept a challenge that many modern games do not offer and see if you have the wits and perseverance to role-play in the old school style. If you long for the depth of story and challenging quests of the golden era of computer role playing games, Lurking I is for you.  [version info] - view ReadMe.txt in download package for more info.  v3.0:  Why not. New tile set, LARGER display, and some other cosmetic changes. Largely untested for bugs that may have been introduced in the process. In particular, the stairs from original tile set where kind of visually ambiguous as to if they went up or down. The new stair tiles are not... so I suspect some stairs will indicate the wrong direction (i.e. a down-looking stair takes you up). I will be working on this.  v3.1:  Completed the process of verifying every single stairway in the game and ensuring that they represent the proper direction under the new tile set. All ready to go!

"Kobo Redux is a frantic 80's style 2D shooter, inspired by the look and feel of 90's arcade cabinets. The gameplay is fast and unforgiving, although with less of the frustrating quirkiness of the actual games of the 80's. A true challenge in the spirit of the arcade era!  	First, inspired by Bosconian, there was XKobo, a multi-directional scrolling arcade shooter, where the primary objective was to destroy maze-like hostile space bases, while they were hurling bullets, missiles, and ships in your general direction.  	 Kobo Deluxe  brought this addictive little game to basically everything with a CPU, and has had incredible numbers of downloads on various platforms. It is also included in many Linux distros. However, the project was never quite finished, and the game mostly served as a test bed for other little projects, such as  glSDL , and the unnamed sound engine - a precursor of  Audiality 2 .  	  Now, with smoother controls, improved gameplay, a bit of physics, new pixel art, and a proper soundtrack, Kobo Redux aims to be the XKobo update that Kobo Deluxe never quite became.    What you get when you buy Kobo Redux  	 Access to the full Redux sound and graphics themes 	 Access to binaries for the supported platforms 	 Free updates of the above, for as long as the project is maintained 	 Improved chances of updates and more games actually happening! Kobo Redux  has been  Greenlit , so you'll also get a Steam key eventually.   What is available to everyone, under various FOSS licenses  	 Full  game source code 	 Full source code of the  Audiality 2  audio engine 	 Graphics and sound themes included with the game source code   	In other words, while the Kobo Redux media is proprietary, the full game source code is available under the 	 GNU GPL  (some files are under the  GNU LGPL ), and relies only on portable Free/Open Source technologies, such as  SDL  and Audiality 2. The game is fully playable with the included non-proprietary media.  	That is, it is entirely legal to fork the game code and the included free themes in order to develop different versions, or new games, as long as the original licencing terms are not violated.	    If you own Kobo II...  	 If you've previously purchased Kobo II, you get Kobo Redux for free!  You should have received an email with a download key.",Shooter,16-bit||2D||Arcade||Difficult||Fast-Paced||Pixel Art||Retro||sourcecode||Space||Top down shooter,Kobo Redux,olofson.itch.io/kobo-redux

"A remake of the classic arcade game. This is not a rom hack. It's meant to be more difficult than the original giving players new levels and new challenges. I've tried to study the original as close as I can to maintain the same feel, but added new elements and challenges. Even though it can be played on your PC, it's meant to be played in people's mame arcade cabinets.   If you ever put this game in your cabinet, send me a screenshot or video and I will post it here!  [Bug Reports]  Contact me at  justinbohemier@gmail.com  if you find a bug. Please try to be as detailed as possible and include system specs and your configuration settings  [Gamepad support]   The game doesn't support joysticks by itself, but you can use programs like JoyToKey or Xpadder to map out joystick presses to keyboard keys.  [Current Version: 1.1.1]  [Latest Updates]  -Fixed some of the sounds a bit -Added an attract screen demo -Fixed Rendering bug which made the aspect incorrect in full-screen mode when rotated on certain monitors -Fixed key-mapping issues -New Render options in the config app for more screen control. -Fixed Heart bonus item bug. If you were on your last life and you got the heart and died without completing the level, it wouldn't be there in level 1 if you started a new game. -Added 16-bit support for older video cards -Added the option in the config tool to manually enter a specific resolution.  [Changes from the original] -Obviously the levels look different, some completely new, and others have the same level structure with some differences -New switch, laser, and key system to save Pauline. -Mario can jump off high platforms and land without killing himself(c'mon, he's mario) -New heart bonus items are worth 2000 points but are tricky to get. -No intro scene, I might add one though. -Barrels rebound off the floor higher than before -Hitting barrels with the hammer doesn't pause the game during the explosion -Level 4 is icy, with a shoe item you can get that makes it not slipery -and some other stuff  [Possible Future Changes] -More levels. I'm tempted to have 1 long game that doesn't repeat. Instead of repeating every 4 levels, you might have 12 levels with an actual end to the game. -Bonus level if you collect all the hearts. -Intro to the game when you push start. -Cut scenes Install instructions Extract the Zip file and run DK.exe. Press Enter to start. Use the Config tool to remap the keys, enable full screen, and other options.  Anti-Virus Warning : Some people have had their anti-virus flag the exe as a virus, myself included, but I can assure you there's no virus.

"Dungeons and Don't Do It is a DnD parody, or satire about DnD... Namely, how players always find a way to do something stupid and mess up the DM's world.  (For those of you not familiar, DnD is a role-playing game, where players take on the role of an adventurer on a quest, and have great flexibility in choices while the DM- ""Dungeon Master"" creates the story for them.)  While it is possible to play through this game seriously, it isn't the point! There are plenty of silly options and random generated results to go along with the theme and lead your character through a wacky adventure. Beware rng, though! Some options are much more difficult to pass than others.    This game includes:  - Adult language  - Themes such as; murder, really bad murder, failed stat checks, infuriating characters, spam saving, semi-replay-ability, sexuality and last minute quality!  - Easter Eggs! (gotta find em all)  - Random number generator dice rolls for stat checks (where applicable)  - Multiple possibilities per choice as per rng  - Comedic fun as best written in a crazed rush  - Tears, free of charge  The game contains 1,898 dialogue blocks, containing 15,783 words and 83,787 characters, for an average of 8.3 words and 44 characters per block.

You need to solve puzzles, collect valuable items, fight dangerous enemies and regain the piece of the world by collecting the four ancient relics.   Procedurally generated world  Every time you start a new game, you can enter a so called 'Seed'. This is a number that determines how your game world is created. The seed affects the outside overworld, caves, houses, dungeons, NPCs and the quest logic (order of items you have to obtain in order to progress). For the sake of showcasing and simplicity, in this alpha version you will have access to every dungeon of the world instantly. But inside the dungeons, you have to get an item in order to beat it. It's fascinating to see so many different worlds and possibilities, it's an endless adventure!   What this Alpha contains  In this early version of the game you will be able to find 5 usable items. Each one has it's unique ways to open up paths and reveal secrets. There are countless hidden stairways and caves outside of the dungeons. They contain value items, materials (which are not used yet, but will be later on) and items that increase your life and mana power. You can talk to persons which will give you advice in finding locations or useful hints on how to find secrets. Consider this more of a tech-demo or very early build, there will be bugs!

You will be able to configure the keys in a later version, until then, here's the input table:   What if I find a bug?

"The goal of the game is simple; be the last player alive. But.... You're surrounded.. Harmless NPCs mostly, but there's some players blending in with them. How will you find them? How will they find you? This is a game for 2 or more players, with up to 64 NPCs.You can play over LAN or WAN. There's no Server Browser (yet), so you'll have to connect directly via IP. NETWORK PROBLEMS:   If you're having troubles connecting to other players, there are 2 usual causes: The Firewall, and the Router. All players should make sure their firewall isn't blocking the game in any way, or it likely won't connect. The latest update added NAT punchthrough, which should prevent the router from causing problems. If problems remain, the host should forward the port being used on their router (default 7777). How to do either of these depends on your OS/router, so you'll need to search online for the best way. If it still doesn't work, let me know. HOW TO UPDATE:  When getting a message about an update being available, simply re-download the game from this page - it will be the latest version. Alternatively, you can keep the game automatically updated with the Itch App ( https://itch.io/app ). Update 0.1.8a: Engine updated (includes various network fixes). Update 0.1.7abc: A: New level - Host can pick the level in the GAME CONFIG menu in the Lobby. Lots of optimizations and bug fixes (including walking bug?). B: Added NAT Punchthrough (Experimental, but seems stable) - it should now be easier to connect to other players, hopefully without the need for portforwarding. Version check bypass has been added, but should only be used if you know you have the latest version, or everyone else has the same version. C: Different versions might not work properly with eachother. UI now scales to screen size - JOIN button no longer appears off-screen on 5:4 monitors. Update 0.1.6ab: Engine upgrade, Quality options in Pause Menu, more stable network connection, fixed bug where only one person readying-up would start the game, instead of all. Disabled GPU Skinning (should make things better for anyone without a GPU). Bug fixes. Update 0.1.5abc: Updated engine version. Networking should be better, input shouldn't be dropped, input no longer based on camera, along with other optimizations. Update 0.1.4ab: Added basic Options menu (sensitivity, invert Y-Look), reduced download + overall filesize. Solved walk bug (should work on all devices and keyboards now) and rotation error (output_log shouldn't get spammed with Quaternion errors) Note: This is super-alpha. The core of the game exists, but it's still pretty basic. I've tried to make it as latency-friendly as possible, but emulating high-latency is pretty useless compared to actual high-latency. So, if you experience any issues due to networking, or have some ideas/feedback, please let me know either by email ( contact@pheonise.com ), or on twitter ( @Pheonise ).",,3D||Multiplayer||unity3d,Last Man Standing,pheonise.itch.io/last-man-standing

"Steam key and DRM free version included!  In a universe driven by targets, a faceless corporation employs you to create an evolving ecosystem you can never hope to control...  Intelligent Design: An Evolutionary Sandbox is a god game with fully simulated genetics and evolution. Create species of plants, herbivores and carnivores and try to control the ever evolving ecosystem. Design and create genetically modified organisms, but remember when you start tampering with genetics it is hard to undo your mistakes...  This is a game for people who don’t want to be given all the answers. A game for people who like to experiment with a simulation, at their own pace, and watch what happens.   	 Key Features  Fully modelled genetics and evolution The behavior of each organism are determined by their genetics. How tall will a plant grow? How fast can an herbivore run? How often does a carnivore seek prey? These genetics are passed down generation after generation along with random mutations. Evolution is fully simulated, there are no tricks or statistical approximations. You are watching life evolve on your computer.  Science to be Done  What do all those genes actually do? How is the world score calculated? What does world efficiency even mean? Much like a real scientist you will need to investigate, analyse and work with other players to try and answer these questions. To help you along the way the game outputs data in xml files so you can really get your science on.   Genetic Engineering  Create your own genetically modified organisms, but be careful, once a genome has entered your ecosystem it may be hard to undo the damage ... and are you sure you really know what those genes do yet?  Secrets to Discover  Who is employing you to create this ecosystem? Why are they doing it? Why are you doing it? What are those targets for? The answers to these any many other questions are out there, you just need to work together and find them...

"01/11/2019: Uploaded 0.1 - Fixed the bug where you couldn't access the sketchbook and bonus scenes even after collecting all ending achievements. Your progress will be carried over automatically after downloading the new version.  Story  You live in a small, peaceful village. Every day is the same as any other; boring. Right when you wish for something exciting to happen, strange things start to occur, stemming from the nearby forest. If that isn't enough, the locals have begun disappearing. At the same time you meet four mysterious guys. Will you discover the truth before becoming the next target?  Rating:  16+, for violence, (mild) blood and suggestive themes   Features ♦  4 routes, each with a unique storyline ♦  16 possible endings, 4 per storyline ♦  At least 10 hours playtime - 60,000 - 70,000 words per storyline. Total 270,608 words ♦  8+ side characters, vary per route.  ♦  60 CG art/20+ cut scenes ♦  60 Original background art ♦  37 Original soundtracks ♦  29 Achievements ♦  Opening video ♦  Bonus material  Q: Will there be a suggested route order? A: There isn’t an official order, because each route is puzzle piece of the whole. Although, some routes are more connected than others. Like Zeikun and Sachiro. If you are going to play all routes anyway, I suggest to start off with Zeikun or Sachiro as an introduction to the story. Kurato and Junoru routes are more plot heavy so I’d do them as last.  If you enjoy keeping hooked on mysteries I suggest this order: Sachiro> Zeikun> Kurato > Junoru. To understand hints given in other routes I suggest this order: Kurato > Zeikun > Sachiro or Junoru.  After reaching any normal/romantic ending of other characters, it unlocks an extra scene at the ending of Kurato.   Main Cast   ♦  Heroine  (re-nameable)  —  A bored girl who seeks mysteries. ♦  Zeikun  —  A rude and straightforward man. ♦  Junoru — Quiet and mysterious gentle man. ♦  Sachiro  —  A lost boy who asks for your help. ♦  Kurato  —  Despite his cheerful personality, the heroine questions his intentions.

"Follow Kynseed at any of these lovely locations:  Kynseed Discord  Community Forums  Twitter  Facebook Steam   Hello there itch.io traveler,  What you see here is an extremely early prototype of our game that we used during the Kynseed Kickstarter. We've been fortunate enough to have had a successful campaign and so over the past number of months we've been developing this humble prototype into a full game. Much of this prototype's content is now  very  outdated (particularly character art and animations!), so take everything with a grain of wheat...erm, salt.  If you'd like to join us on this game dev adventure, then check out the links listed above and come hang out with us. We've also got  a late backer program  for anyone who missed the Kickstarter but still wants access to the rewards and other goodies. Many thanks to all of you who have downloaded this early chapter of Kynseed's development story - over 10,000 of you at last count! We look forward to continuing along this journey with you all.  Love, PixelCount     	   	   	Kynseed is a 2D sandbox adventure from veterans of Lionhead Studios' Fable series. Drawing from years of experience crafting the iconic Fable titles, we aim to deliver an all-new quirky RPG filled to the brim with mystery, exploration, awful puns, and sandbox possibilities.	   	While invoking the spirit of past Fable games, Kynseed is infused with our own ideas and a mix of British folklore, ancient legend, and rustic traditions. We hope to capture these inspirations in an atmospheric world with whimsy, humour, and eccentricity, and not a single orc or high elf in sight.  	   	Spend your days adventuring, farming the land while raising your family, or even running your own tavern, apothecary, blacksmiths or goods store.  	Every person and domestic animal you meet remembers what you do, or fail to do.  	You can step off The Path into the darker areas of Quill and encounter faery tale monsters and enticing mysteries.  	The seasons will pass and living things will grow old and die. Faces from the past are replaced by the fresh young faces of new life.  	You have grown up in your parent's idyllic farm in The Vale, a peaceful valley in the faery tale land of Quill. In time, you meet the mysterious Mr Fairweather, who offers you a mystical acorn called the Kynseed. Once planted, it will grow a magical family tree.	   	But such a gift does not come without a price. And when you die of old age yourself, you will pass your family tree's Kynseed on to your children so that they may continue your bloodline and shape their own legacy.	   	Will your name be carved on the walls of history or scrawled on the walls of the pub outhouse?  	   	   	    The following features are to be added over the course of development and are not necessarily present in this prototype. Follow Kynseed's full development over on  our community forums  or  Discord .  	 An Aging World 	The land is affected by your choices and deeds. Seasons come and go and affect the world both visually and in gameplay.  	 Living Things Have Memory and Grow Old 	Individuals and animals grow old and eventually die. Families remember your good deeds or wrongdoings for generations.  	 Unique Life Mechanic 	Pay the mysterious Mr Fairweather for powerful upgrades and revivals, at the cost of years from your life! Will you miss out on your child's development to buy that music box that makes dragons dance? Will your business suffer because you bought a pet cat that turns people to stone?  	   	   	 Real-time Combat Wander from The Path and indulge in meaty combat against various nasty faery tale creatures that guard the materials and loot you need to become the greatest in the land.  	 Meaningful Relationship System 	Build friendship into romance and produce heirs to continue your legacy. Do favours for others and not only gain friendship but also juicy information and gifts.  	   	 Event Calendar 	A calendar keeps you up to date of festivals and events. Learn where and when the best ingredients grow. Attend various competitions, annual fayres, and don't you dare be late for a date!  	 Monsters and Creatures 	They're more than just sword fodder. Each creature has a sim and their own traits that you can take advantage of. Remember, even dragons need to go to the bathroom now and then. (That wasn't a pile of gold that Smaug sat on!)  	 Run Your Business 	Own a tavern and craft beers with bizarre effects. Be a blacksmith and forge weapons and tools to order. Manage your apothecary and mix cures for a variety of bizarre poxes and curses.  	   	 A Land Where Superstitions Are True 	Heed the advice of the Old Fishwife and the locals to find out everything from where the rarest items can be found to where and when the best places to conceive are! We're not just a little stitious. We're super stitious.  	 Olde Traditions 	 Every village has their own customs and quirks. Visit the annual cheese bowling rite and encounter Wiki Men, Fred Barleycorn and wear the Trousers of Fertility, as passed down through generations. (I really hope they wash them...)  	 Recipes 	Hunger dictates combat prowess so a proper breakfast before some monster slaying goes a long way. Discover and use proper recipes though, and you can take your fighting to the next level, or even use the Traits in food to distract, weaken or even scare away enemies!  	 Item Traits 	All items and materials, have unique traits. From medicinal to hallucinogenic, shrinking to fattening...Want to feed laxatives to herds of sheep and lead them through town? The creative possibilities for fun are endless.  	   	   	 Be Friends with Animals 	Domestic animals and critters have opinions of you based on your actions. If they like you enough they may just let you ride them!  	 Lovely Music 	No mythical world would be complete without music to go with it. The title music has been made by Russell Shaw but also helping us out with some beautiful world music is Matthijs den Daas. Here's a couple of tracks you can expect to hear in our prototype. We'll be adding much more music as development continues.    	   	 KYNSEED PROTOTYPE GAMEPAD CONTROLS   	 (You can also access the list of controls ingame by pressing left on the D-PAD.)

(Full development has far exceeded this version!) This update is mainly a minor update to 'lock in' the prototype so that we can move on to working on the core areas of the larger game . This patch is primarily minor tweaks and improvements so if you have played previous versions you likely won't see anything new - just a slightly more refined experience for the UI, controls, and other small fixes. This also might be the last update for a fair while or perhaps even until the early access build planned for a half year from now. We want to make sure that the early access build is as good as possible and to do that we'll be giving it our complete focus. Worry not though, we'll absolutely still keep you all up to date and suitably tantalised with progress on the game as it develops via updates like these as well as over  in the PixelCount community .  All music has been rebalanced and sound quality improved A whole bunch of invisible editor work on resizing levels, moving/copying/cutting, and pasting selected game objects and tiles Toolbar adjustments to have highlights when mouse is over something and to allow unselecting by left clicking on the current active item Cooking has a filter option to just show ingredients for the current recipe and to show red for any you don't have of the current recipe Intro and outro text adjusted Bit of a tidy up on the right side of Dreamer's Nook tiles as well as removing some unused objects from the level Fix for inventory flickering with controller (had to do with mouse overriding the position) Mouse wheel for toolbar works better at cycling through options if there are multiple of the same item or gaps Individual bottles and buckets are now visible in the inventory and equippable if you are lucky enough to find multiple - it shows the contents of them in the picture as well Mouse wheel can now change tabs in the inventory/calendar screens (this is just a test - in the future we might make it more sensitive context as to what scrolls) Gift giving wheel now has a more consistent border Changed some messages over to use the newer warning system (the old ones are banners that fly across the top) Query option filters to Any, Queried, To Query Improved book presentation a little to match other menus (note it's all still placeholder that will change but making it consistent for now helps ease the process of changing it over later) Pigs no longer show 'dead' status after they come back to life Adjusted the position of UI elements slightly and made them configurable for future tweaking Fixed bottom left icons so they can be mouse clickable Insects weren't correctly cleaned up from the jar on collection The tool pickup menu selection with mouse and keyboard are slightly improved with highlights over where the item will go and equip or close options if you want to switch immediately Various minor UI tweaks in particular to calendar/inventory so that it is formatted a bit better and to also fix a few minor issues found Started work on a system for internal and external feedback where you can add notes ingame - will look to show this in a dev video when it's ready  If you encounter any problems please contact us on  our forums ,   Twitter ,  Facebook , or at  Feedback@Kynseed.com . Thank you for playing and we hope you enjoy this rather hefty update!  	   	   	   	   	We are a team of three little pigs building a brick house to keep the wolf from the door. Two of those pigs are ex-Lionhead Studios developers and the other ran the Fable community for many years. With over 30 Years of experience developing the Fable series and its community (amongst others), we hope to infuse our games with the same charm, eccentricity and humour that permeated Lionhead's games.  	   	 Neal Whitehead 	 Co-Founder and Technical Director 	 ( Twitter )   	Neal has worked as a scripter, coder, and tools creator for nearly every Fable over the course of 12 years as well as a gameplay scripter on Black & White 2. He was Lionhead's 2nd best table tennis player, perhaps best shmup player, and boasts a stupidly high score on Threes. He is also a Streetfighter expert and fanboy, although he can't cope with button mashers and for a polite and quiet guy he sure swears like a sailor.

He cut his teeth as a tester on Black and White then Fable and ended up designing and building the Albion of both Fable 2 and Fable 3. Charlie lived for Lionhead - quite literally as he once lived there secretly for 9 days.

Showing how we tend not to resist, letting big companies own everything, even our own soul at some point... 	Resisting the capitalism means today being excluded from the system, tending to become invisible when you just don't fit. Because of that we have no other choice but to run after purchasing power, that's how it is...  	I won't say more to avoid spoiling the experiment, and I didn't put any screenshot to avoid that too.

Play as Bonnie Starr, a former farmgirl turned infamous pistoleer as she attempts to gain redemption at the end of a gun.  Dead Horizon is inspired by the light gun games of old. No, not Area 51, Time Crisis or Virtua Cop. The real old ones, like the original Wild Gunmen, Namco Quick & Crash, and Mad Dog McCree. This game was inspired by those and the developer's own fascination with westerns and their machismo focused story lines on masculinity, murder, and guns. This game has all those things, and more! And it's 100% free! And very, very short.  :Features Include:  Gameplay only involves the mouse. We've cut out those useless fidgety bits, like keyboards! Out of date graphics, like you remember from that childhood before you were born! Out of date soundtrack, so fabulous you'll want to own it separately! Quickdraw duels with over five dangerous hombres! Classic 4:3 aspect ratio, just for those that missed it! Kill some people that probably deserve it! Learn from the best shootist this side of the sunken desert! Kill some people that maybe don't deserve it! Getting to know whether or not you'd miss! The game is totally free!

"We've all felt the pain of loss, depression or anxiety. It's almost impossible to not be affected by at least one of these things in day to day life. They can make you feel like you've sunk to a depth that there is no easy escape.  What if that pit was a real entity you needed to conquer in order to  move on? That is the world of  Rock Bottom . Face increasingly more difficult platforming levels to climb to the top, collecting new skills and finding the secrets of the story hidden throughout.   Rock Bottom  is Platypus Paradox's second submission to the  Northern Game Design Challenge . This year's theme was crowd sourced by the participants for each different genre teams chose (we picked 2D Platformer prior to the competition). We received ""High Concept Art"" and hit the ground running with it.  This year's team was composed of Jean Francois Poulin (lead programmer), Khris Finley (music and sound design), Joel Boucher (level design, programmer) and Paul Ungar (art and animation).  There are elements that were made for the game that didn't ultimately make it it due to time constraints: additional animation (both character and environment), additional art assets, improved UI/UX, fine tuned mechanics and controls, additional levels. We are really proud of the project we completed during the competition and over the next few months will be working towards a full release with many more levels, puzzles and mechanics.   If you play the game, please leave a comment and a review. Any and all feedback is appreciated!  (Play in fullscreen for the best experience!)  Stay tuned for more updates!

So you decide to go on a roadtrip with your childhood friends, to a lake where you spent your summers together in the past. But on the way there, you realize that a lot has changed since you were kids.   Features  Colorful, atmospheric handcrafted graphics A highly detailed bus to explore Soundtrack featuring various indie artists An amount of dialogue we've never bothered to count Will last you anywhere between 20 to 45 minutes No objectives to fulfill, so take your time   Background  Development started back in February of 2018 as part of our final thesis at university, where the two of us developed it for five months until we graduated in June.  Since then, it has received pretty positive reactions, encouraging us to start development of an all new version of Northbound.  This is not that new version. In fact, this version, now dubbed 'Long Road Ahead', is pretty much exactly the one we graduated with.  We are uploading it here in order to clear our heads, re-process our development and design processes that led us to this version, and to gather feedback. We hope that all of this will help us with development of the new version of Northbound, so please let us know if you liked it.

"ABOUT THIS GAME  There’s always time for one more round in this fast and frantic 4 players party brawler. Each of the fighters has a crazy ability that’s a bit unfair, so it’s all about being a bit unfairer-than your friends. Punch through walls, teleport, snipe with extreme deadly accuracy or just be a massive laser shooting sausage - but you can’t be all of them. So pick your favourite fighter and battle your friends in super short and intense one-hit-kill matches in 3 different modes. Domiverse is best enjoyed accompanied by the assumption of some mild physical violence between friends, playing together in front of the TV. When not brawling with friends you can tackle the single player arcade mode, or train to become the ultimate Domiverse competitor by smashing through target courses in challenge mode. Unlock several hidden characters, hand-drawn comics explaining the backstory of the fighters taking part in the Domiverse tournament and more.

Bitsy  is a small tool by  Adam Le Doux  for building little games with extremely basic graphics and gameplay - each object and tile can only have one primary color (usually based on a 3 color palette) and the game engine basically just allows you to move around in four directions and interact with people and items.  These restrictions sound harsh, but in fact are very helpful for building small focussed experiences and people have built  a ton of interesting, charming and unique experiences  since the tool was released.  WHY DOING THIS GAME?  My idea was: why not go and de-make a very beloved game of mine (Super Mario Land for Nintendo Gameboy) and try to emulate the gameplay as exactly as possible - using a tool that isn't intended for platformers at all and that has even simpler graphics than the original Gameboy? :D  So, here is the first ""real"" platformer done in Bitsy. It was a fun experiment, at least for one level. Hope you like it.  --===--  CREDITS  A demake by  Matthias Falk  ""I Like Jump Rope"" by  Ozzed (licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution License)  ""Termosdynamik"" by  Ozzed (licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution License)  ""Mushrooms"" by  Komiku (licensed under a  CC0 1.0 Universal License )  Thanks to:  Adam Le Doux  (Bitsy Game Maker)  ayolland  and  Sean S Le Blanc  (Borksy Game Hacker and Bitsy Hacks)  gritfish  (PuzzleBit, mobile UI for Bitsy)  ruin  (Image to Bitsy)  --===--",Platformer,1-bit||2D||8-Bit||Bitsy||Game Boy||mario||Pixel Art||Retro||Short,Super Bitsy Land,pocketfruit.itch.io/super-bitsy-land

The prelude is a short version of the game telling the story of a warrior named Eghoss in search of a mythical artifact.    This seemingly simple adventure will let any one dive into the world of Ethistos and preface the grand adventure to come. Some answers about the arrival of a mysterious Rogue Empire will be answered but much more questions will appear along Eghoss adventure.  It is/will be also worth noticing the prelude is a complete game by it self only not so big in length and with a fixed character.

"They finally let her out, it's time for her to go back home. But it's getting dark now.  Use the A and D keys to move her.   I often spoke to them in the late hours, but they only spoke back when I turned the lights off. I asked them if they knew why I was here and they told me it was because I was different. They told me that I only knew they were there because I was different, but that wasn't the difference that put me in here. They would follow me when I left my room and they stood around me while I was on the table. They were the only thing that kept me together, the only thing I had to hold onto. As I was different so were they, it was why they were here too. Like we all were from a different place then this one. Their shadows were the only contrast I had in that world of white. When I was released, I never saw them again. But sometimes I still hear them when the lights are off. Sometimes they pull me one way when I'm walking another. They say I need to survive, that the world needs me. That more then one world needs me. They told me I was one of the prophecies, the prophecies that were used to paint her portrait. I want to believe them, I want to be special. But sometimes I forget things that are there, and sometimes I remember things that aren't there.

Despite the mismatched nature of each member and the world around them, what keeps them all together runs deeper than the surface.  Human life has experienced a prosperous boom worldwide. Living conditions are above the minimum on a much broader scale, previously unsolved cures appear one by one, and surgical repair is as simple as spraying yourself with a specialized powder.

Can their newfound feelings help them overcome their hesitations and insecurities or will they continue playing mind games to hide their vulnerabilities?  Kokorogawari also navigates the intricacies of familial relationships rather than just focusing on romantic emotions alone.  This sets us apart from many otome visual novels as “family” is a theme that is rarely explored- even though it's a significant element of almost everybody’s lives!  	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  	 Heroine:   	 	   Having witnessed her mother's many hardships during the divorce thirteen years ago, our heroine Asami has a cynical opinion of love and marriage. Though she can be untrusting of others, she greatly values the people she shares a bond with.   Asami is good at hiding her emotions, so she turns to art and literature to express herself. She's currently undertaking an internship at Edo Publishing in the editorial department.   	 Love interests:   	 	   Asami's classmate and the charismatic leader of Touzaka Uni's Art Club. Shinichi may be street-smart and shrewd, but he maintains an approachable disposition. His peers respect him for his prowess in art and literature.   A former student of a fine arts university ""BiDai"", Shinichi is two years older despite being in the same year level as Asami. For some reason, Asami treats him coldly and his jokes(?) always roll off her back...  	   Yuuya is another intern at Edo Publishing, but he's in the marketing department. As he has never had a girlfriend, his senior colleagues at Edo often try to pair him up with Asami or tease him about other things.   He has poor eyesight and wears glasses on a daily basis. Yuuya is a polite and well-mannered man who is good at his job, but seems to be hiding many secrets...?     Guillam is confident and ambitious, but also a bit of a flirt and may come across as shallow. His Japanese is good enough to carry out everyday conversation without trouble, though he still slips up occasionally.  He initially came to Japan on a business-cum-holiday trip, but ended up staying due to various work-related reasons. Guillam is passionate about art and his career, being a firm believer of mixing business with pleasure.   	====================================  	 Soundtrack:     	*************************************************************  	 System/Specifications:    	 To ensure that Kokorogawari is working properly you should have following system requirements: 	- Windows XP, Visa, 7, 8 or 10	 	- Linux	 	- Mac OS X 10.6 and higher 	 	 Heroine sprite will show with a great variety of expressions, so always check out the sprite expressions!

"2016 Sammy Awards Presented By UC Santa Cruz  	   	   2017 Independent Games Festival  	   	   	Project Perfect Citizen is an interactive narrative experience that addresses government surveillance in the modern digital age. In this alternate-day dystopia, the player takes on the role of a no-name employee at the Department of Cyber Police and Security: a division of the government tasked with monitoring all domestic communications within ""The Nation"". After obtaining a warrant from an automated database extraction system, the player is granted access to their target's Desktop in order to collect incriminating evidence to prove the target's guilt. But when the line between criminality and the everyday struggle is blurred, the player must look to their own conscience to arrest or exonerate the targets he or she is surveilling. In all, Perfect Citizen seeks to take the player on a thought provoking journey through the personal lives of imperfect citizens in order to push the bounds of games as a storytelling medium and create a tense yet intimate gameplay experience that directly engages with the conversation of privacy and security.  	   	     www.projectperfectcitizen.com  	    Install instructions Simply download the mac or windows build and run the installer.

"Wallclip  is a difficult fast-paced single-button platforming game where you have to reach the end of a long level which opens-up with time.    Up-Arrow                                       Jump             Esc/Enter                         Pause               ‎‎‎  ‎‎‎‎  ‎‎‎‎  To make this easier, you are  able to  smash through certain walls  by  building up enough speed to clip through them , while being careful not to accidently fall into  bottomless pits   or touch  lava . Dying doesn't reset the level giving you more space to accelerate.  Your movement speed increases  automatically , but hitting a wall or jumping gives you a  small speedboost.  I got my inspiration from the speedrunning scenes of games like  Super Mario 64  where  buiding up speed to glitch through walls are often used to skip large parts of a game.   The movement mechanics were directly inspired by the  Blue Shell  Item from the Nintendo DS game  New Super Mario Bros. ‎  ‎‎‎ This game is also compatible and optimized for mobile devices!  ‎‎ This game was made in a timespan of 48 hours in Construct 2 for the Wowie Game Jam.

This is Disco Soul's autobiographical version of events. They may be unreliable, factually incorrect, or plain made-up to make him look good. If we ever get a perfectly reliable chain of events, it'll probably be released as 'Curse of Dogs', and be longer and more fun! Consider this the 'Demo Version', except none of the scenes will make it into the actual 'Curse of Dogs'! Please enjoy this standalone story within the Curse of Dog's world! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Holy Moly! I can't believe I finished this game all by myself! What? ChillTaco? qualifiedbadger? Nah, I just dictated what happened to those guys, I did all the hard work myself. Honest!

"ANNOUNCEMENT: I have taken the game down. I'm leaving the page up, but the downloads have been removed. Check the latest devlog for more info on this. What is Unreal PT  Unreal PT is a short psychological horror game, completely recreating the athmosphere and gameplay of the PT originally published on the Playstation 4.   About the Making of Unreal PT  Unreal PT was under constant development over the course of 9 months, starting in April 2018 and ending in January 2019. Textures, models, animations, gameplay, and code have been recreated from scratch (more details on this in the development logs).   Specs/Technical  Performance:  The game has been optimized; however, there are graphics options to help further increase performance if you have a less powerful GPU .  Minimum Tested Specs:  CPU: i3-7100U 7th Generation with Intel HD 620 GPU: Integrated RAM: 8GB DDR4 HQ SSR Turned off and resolution at 35% gets ~30fps with these specs  Gameplay Notes  Supported controls:  Mouse + Keyboard, Playstation and Xbox controllers, VR motion controllers.   Additional Notes:  The gameplay is nearly identical to the original. The biggest difference is the very end of the game has been changed slightly to make beating it more consistent. The controls are explained as the game progresses, but if you get stuck at any point I've included two text files in the main directory, one with the controls, the other with a guide on how to beat the game.  VR    I've been looking through forums, and it looks like VR is completely busted and has multiple issues. You are welcome to try it, but I don't recommend it. NOTE:  I have fixed a lot of the bugs people have pointed out to me. Info about this is in the new devlog.   I hope you guys enjoy playing this as much as I loved making it!

"A creativity-driven RPG about a rundown theatre and pleasing its unruly clientele.  Nobody said that opening a theatre on the wrong side of the river was going to be easy! The roof may be leaking, and the audience may be armed to the teeth, but nothing is going to stop the Rainsdowne Players from becoming the premier (and only!) theatre troupe in town!  Features:  Correctly handle 'friendly encouragement' from your audience, in the form of thrown bottles, tomatoes and even the occasional fish. Collect inspiration cards from the audience, and combine them to concoct new plays to please the pickier customers. Hang out with a homeless cat who likes board games. Convince the ticket desk clerk not to leave her dead end job. Survive a boss battle in the form of several hundred disinterested schoolchildren. Plays like if Paper Mario and Majora's Mask had a child, but the father was secretly Rhythm Tengoku.  The Rainsdowne Players is an RPG about winning hearts and minds. Explore the town of Rainsdowne and get to know the peculiar inhabitants, all of whom may have a particular play they want to see, even if they don't realise it yet! Gather inspiration in the form of cards and use it to build the narrative of your next show, but it's never quite that simple and whether dodging projectiles or surviving a sword fight, you've got to actually make it through the performance in one piece!  A note from the Rainsdowne Tourist Board:  Due to a faulty and irreversible weather charm several hundred years ago, the town of Rainsdowne does get an awful lot of rain, but don't let that dampen your spirits! There's lots to see and do around town:  Try and sink some questionably depicted pirates at the cannon range. Take part in our lively card battling scene. There's always a tournament running. Enjoy some surprisingly relaxing fishing by the docks. Enjoy some surprisingly non-relaxing yoga in the park. Take to the stage at the Royal Flush bar, which was definitely not a public washroom only a few weeks ago.   Also available on  Nintendo Switch !",Role Playing||Card Game,Comedy||Cozy||GameMaker||JRPG||Non violent||Pixel Art||Relaxing||theatre,The Rainsdowne Players,rainsdowne.itch.io/the-rainsdowne-players

"Don't have the Unity Web Player? Don't worry! Scroll down to download the standalone version (Win/Mac/Linux). 	 Are you completely clueless about what is going on? (Even after the tutorial?)  Watch  this great explanation  by Marc ten Bosch about playing in 4D. 	  	 Brane  is a mobile/web/pc puzzle game set in a four dimensional world. The player can switch one of the usual dimensions with the fourth dimension to navigate a 4D puzzle. 	It was inspired by the beautiful, long-awaited 	 Miegakure  by Marc ten Bosch, and can in fact be thought as a free alternative or at least an homage to this game. Videos 	 jumpsplat120's let's play  Gameplay 	Brane is set in a real 4D environment. You only see and move in 3 of them at a time; however, you have the power to swap one of the dimensions you can see with the hidden fourth dimension. Once the new dimension is visible, you can just walk along it normally. 	As the fourth dimension is rotated into view, objects seem to distort, disappear, rotate. Really, it's just your perspective that's changing. The 4D world and the 4D objects in it are pretty much static, but the hyperplane in which you live rotates around your position and slices the objects in different and new ways. The 3D sections of objects are what you end up seeing.  Development  	The game is currently in early development. Please report any bugs 	 in this subreddit . 	 Alpha 0.6 - Current Features:  	 12 levels 	 Walk in a minimalistic 4-dimensional world, with hypercubes and hyperspheres 	 Push blocks in the four dimensions. 	 4D LASERS.

"Kalaban  is a survival horror game with an emphasis on storytelling. The game was developed with Clickteam Fusion 2.5.   STORY: The year is 1995, in an alternate history version of  Finland . Bob, a hermit and an American who has moved to Finland, lives in a backwater cabin by himself. One night he is attacked by a hideous dog-like mutant. Now he must find out what is going on, and discover the reason behind the mutant outbreak.  FEATURES:    Unique story and characters:  While the game has a basic premise of mutant invasion, it also features a story with real depth and complexity.   Top-down action:  Combat and exploration are the heart  of this game. You kill monsters, gain loot and eat food to heal yourself. We wanted to make the combat fun and approachable.  Mini-sandbox:  After the introduction, the player is let  loose on the gameworld. You're given the freedom to explore the setting in a non-linear fashion.  Dark comedy:  The game is presented with a serious tone, but beneath it lies absurd comedy, with strange events and characters.  Player choice matters:  Your actions and choices affect  the how the story plays out. The game can be described as an immersive sim from a top-down perspective.    Hand-crafted world:  All the level backgrounds are unique, and the main character is completely hand-animated. We wanted to achieve a high level of polish with the art.        Back to the 90s:  The game is set in the recent past of Finland. The game is littered with tropes and references to the pop culture of the yesteryear. In addition to that, we've taken many influences from older adventure games and DOS titles.",Adventure||Action||Survival,Atmospheric||Exploration||Horror||Isometric||multimedia-fusion||Open World||Singleplayer||Survival Horror,Kalaban,rayharry.itch.io/kalaban

"Rise to Ruins is at heart a  godlike village simulator , but it also throws in plenty of familiar game play mechanics from classic 90s era real-time strategy games like Settlers, along with some tower defense and survival elements in an attempt to create a new kind of village simulator. The goal is to try to bridge the gap between the depth and complexity of traditional village simulators, the fun of godlikes and the simplicity of real-time strategy.  Build a village, and die trying!  A major part of the game is village management, and trying to discover new and creative ways to use the tools at your disposal to keep yourself alive as long as possible. In this game, you will lose frequently, but with every failure you learn a little bit more about how to survive and apply that knowledge to your next attempt.  Several Game Modes  Currently, the game offers three game modes.  Survival ,  Sandbox  and  Peaceful . Survival  is the game the way it was meant to be played, as a brutal survival style village sim, you will probably die often trying to figure out the best way to survive, but that's half the fun right?! Peaceful  is very similar to Survival, but it's balanced much like a traditional village simulator with some godlike and RTS elements sprinkled on top. The monster spawn rates are much lower, and the main focus is keeping your village happy and fed. It's a very easy mode, designed for casual players, or players just wanting to experiment. Sandbox , like the name implies, is a mode where you can play around with the game mechanics. Change the time of day, weather, spawn monsters or villagers, or even edit the map while you're playing on it. This is the ultimate ""Screw around"" mode for players wanting to play with the game mechanics.  Godlike Elements  Not only can you manage your village, but you also have many godlike abilities at your disposal. You can alter the terrain, blast enemies from afar, pick up objects or creatures, heal your villagers, speed up resource growth and all sorts of other fun godly stuff.  Tons of map set themes!  Every set of maps will follow a certain theme (Forest, Desert, Underground, etc). Most of the current screenshots only feature a few of these map sets. But many more are planned.  The Soundtrack!  A full original soundtrack, made by  Bibiki Garcia  that blends orchestral instruments in a way fans of old 1990s era PC gaming will love and remember! SixtyGig Games is a DRM free independent game developer! Rise to Ruins will not now or ever in the future have any sort of DRM! Piracy protection only hurts you guys, the loyal paying players. So you rest assured knowing that once you buy yourself a copy of Rise to Ruins you'll never again have to concern yourself with nagging questions about if you can continue playing the game down the road due to something like always-online logins, lost registration codes or because you bought a new computer and you're only licensed to put the game on one. All I ask from you is to be reasonable and responsible, you can buy the game and play it as much as you like, wherever you like. Just tell your friends to support my DRM-Free philosophy and buy their own copy! Free Content Patches, no paid-DLC I don't believe in paying for Downloaded Content.

You can choose to either play the role of a love interest and try to win the heroine's heart, or... you can play your own game and try to make the two boys fall for you instead! The choice is yours!

I asked her what she was selling and she laughed and said nothing, nothing at all, that what she had to offer was free for anyone who wanted it bad enough. I asked her what had helped her. She just said 'James.'""  Sagebrush  is a first-person narrative adventure about exploring the compound of an apocalyptic Millenialist cult in remote New Mexico years after they collectively took their lives in a mass suicide event.  In  Sagebrush , you'll investigate the long-abandoned Black Sage Ranch, the former home of Perfect Heaven, an apocalyptic cult formed in the early 1990s under the guiding hand of the prophet Father James.  Inspired by Real-World Apocalyptic Cults  Based on extensive research into cult groups both famous and obscure, large and small, Sagebrush avoids simplistic motivations and easy answers. The members of the Flock are diverse and complex people with varied needs, hopes, and fears.  An Immersive, Lo-Fi 3D World  Sagebrush features an evocative low-poly, low-resolution, less-is-more art style that combines retro aesthetics with modern technology, along with a fully-realized soundscape and an original ambient musical score that immerses you in the remote New Mexico desert.  A Whole Compound to Explore  Black Sage Ranch is yours to wander, from the trailers that housed the cultists, to the halls where they gathered for food and prayer, to the old mines that stretch out below the compound, untouched for nearly a century.  Uncover the Real Story  Find notes, recordings, and belongings that give insight into the people who lived at Black Sage Ranch. What did they believe? Why did they join? Were they happy? And why did they choose to end it all?

"When a notorious serial killer's conviction is overturned, the former child detective that put him away must return to the streets to prove his guilt.   But it's been 10 years, and a lot has changed, both in the city of Philadelphia and in Priscilla Vate's world.  When the Shutter Stops is a modern-noir visual novel featuring a heroine with a sordid past whose actions--your choices--shape her view of the world and steer the outcome of the stories within.  About:  Like most private eyes, Priscilla ""Pri"" Vate was unphased by the filth in the world around her. Unlike most detectives, however, Pri was solving crimes at 12 years old. But when one case took her too close, her career was cut short before she could even legally have one.  Ten years later, Pri attempts to put her past behind her as a mundane family photographer. But like the stench of the city, the life of a Philadelphia detective never completely washes off. A decade after the infamous Dart Killer case, the man she locked away is set to be released on new evidence, and now the former child detective must return to the streets to solve the case that put her out of commission, once and for all.  The full version of When the Shutter Stops combines traditional visual novel storytelling with optional point-and-click gameplay, allowing players to conduct their own investigation. A glossary keeps track of clues and lore you discover during the story. Pri can get into a relationship with one of two love interests, one male and one female--or she can eschew romance altogether.

There are some button selection glitches with the Android_b1.0.6 build, but it has no affect on gameplay.  *** EDIT *** Android version is delayed until further notice. I'm focusing on the PC build.  VS PVP Mode does not currently work on WebGL, It will need same keyboard controls as well as custom keybinding for duel controllers. Thank you for your patience!

"A journey of hammer, magic, and might.   This adventure game with strategy and management elements, interesting quests, and hidden objects will entertain you for several days. Build things, participate in battles, use magic items, and brew potions. A whole world will open before your eyes...a world on the brink of disaster.    Explore  Strange creatures living in different locations await you. Some of them will help you, others need your help, and others will take a liking to your head...or, rather, your fresh brains. You will visit quiet villages, snow-capped mountaintops, impenetrable forests, and foul-smelling swamps. But one thing will remain the same - adventure awaits you everywhere!  Collect  Collect everything that isn't bolted to the floor. Dwarves don't mind work, but they won't lift a finger if they don't get normal food. You can't build a mill out of sh*t and sticks, so you'll have to search for the appropriate material. Keep food stocked and your world will expand!  Build  Build bridges over turbulent rivers, build docks in the swamps, repair buildings, and build new ones. Mills will provide food, sawmills will provide building materials, forges will improve equipment - and you can always sell the surplus at the market. All building styles and colors await you in the game.  Complete quests  The people living in this world have always had many worries, and recently they've had more than usual. Try to help everyone, and the reward will be forthcoming. You can also always count on what's most important: sincere words of gratitude*.  * Computer game characters don't have real feelings or minds.  Fight  You can get much further with a kind word and a sword than you can with a kind word alone. Hire experienced soldiers, upgrade their armor and weapons, fight, and conquer. Solve all problems as effectively as possible.  Cast spells  Not enough food or materials? Is your crew dying from their wounds? Did the workers decide to create a union? Magic items and potions will remedy the situation! Save up your gold, complete quests, and open chests. There are many ways to get magic items.

"In the distant future, humanity has discovered a method to replicate matter through the use of a Dimensional Gate. Industry is revolutionized overnight and a short period of chaos gives way to all warring factions uniting under a common banner. A few years pass and the peace brought about by Gate Technology crumbles once a new threat appears; a race of energy parasites that have crossed through the Dimensional Gate by mimicking the very materials humanity had believed they were replicating. Mankind is quickly overtaken as their technology is turned against them and the energy emitted by the parasites begins to take control of those exposed. In an act of desperation, the experimental RSK9 is constructed, a ship made of Pre-Gate materials and technology with the ability to absorb parasite energy and use it to power its incredible arsenal. Piloting the RSK9 is Alys, an ace pilot previously missing in action that has returned seemingly immune to parasite control. Her skill and resistance to the parasite energies influence make her the only pilot capable of preventing the extinction of mankind.  GAME PLAY:  -Increase your B-Meter & firepower quickly by flying as close to enemy fire as possible and absorbing their energy. The closer you fly, the more energy you net!  -Fire your weapon while flying close to enemy fire and absorbing to perform powerful ""Risk Shots"". Enemies destroyed by these powered up shots will turn into energy to power your shield. The best defense is a risky offense! -Fly like an ace pilot and utilize Barrel Rolls to quickly cover vertical space & modify your attack! -Unleash the Barrier Breaker once the B-Meter is full to inflict huge damage on everything in sight!  -Playing for points is fun again as higher scores are awarded for explosive bursts of destruction and taking risks! Destroy multiple enemies at once and utilize ""Risk Shots"" to string together combos and increase your score multiplier!  -Experience different facets and paths to the story based on your performance and actions taken during missions!",Action||Shooter,2D||Arcade||Controller||hi-bit||Pixel Art||Retro||Sci-fi||Shoot 'Em Up,RISK SYSTEM,risksystem.itch.io/rs

Fluttershy never knew that Pinkie felt that way about her, and she struggles to figure out what she wants and how she feels about Pinkie as she finds her way through the date. There are three main routes through the date, and each route has three endings, all with several different variations depending on your prior choices.

In game, you can access a help menu by pressing [ESC] and then clicking ""Help.""  State of The Game:  Development is currently ended for this game as I am working on  Redmatch 2  and Pangaea. I'm not sure if I'll end up updating this game, since it's been 6 months or so now since I started it, and I have learned a lot since then (Including multiplayer networking). I'm planning on releasing a second version of the game rebuilt from the ground up with better systems which make development easier. Because I started it so long ago, most of the code is a complete mess prone to many bugs and ultimately unusable to create anything new. In the next version of Adrift, I hope to map out a plot and purpose before starting development, as well as building all the systems early on based on a chosen end goal of what the game should be. My idea of Adrift changed many times during development, and it truly was an amazing and engaging learning experience. I hope you enjoyed the experience so far. The remake of Adrift will hopefully come out sometime in late 2019 - early 2021. I hope to see you then!

"INTRODUCTION  Mr. Kohei's Horror Show is a psychological horror adventure developed in RPG Maker MV for the  Pixel Horror Jam 2017 .  The game features Kohei, a man who finds himself in a place ""specifically made for him"".

"This is a beta in development.   New features, gameplay systems, and content are being added to the game in monthly updates. As the game is still in development, in this beta version you may encounter bugs or performance issues, and future updates may break compatibility with old save files.  Buying the Idol Manager beta will give you access to the game while it is in beta testing (now until the release of the full game), as well as a full copy of the game when it is officially released (including a Steam key).  When Idol Manager is officially released, it will be sold for $15.   The $25 price for beta access is intended to match the amount that Kickstarter backers pledged for early access to the game before its release.  Beta participants are invited to join our  beta forum , where you can report any bugs you encounter, and can post ideas and suggestions for new content you'd like to see in the game.  We can't promise that all suggestions or feature requests will make it into the game, but many of the performance enhancements and quality-of-life improvements we've already implemented have come as a direct result of feedback from early access playtesters.  Description  You take on the role of manager at a small (but growing!) talent agency. As you cultivate and  train the newest generation of young pop stars , you'll have to decide who to hire and who to fire, who gets promoted when things go well and who gets reprimanded when things get sour. The personal lives of these young celebrities are a part of your business, and the life of a pop star isn't always a happy one. Their crowning personal achievements can be your greatest commercial successes, but their  emotional meltdowns  and  PR nightmares  can spell financial disaster for your company.  It's not just the idols you have to worry about. The world is full of  gossip magazines ,  super fans , and  rival groups , all thirsty for a scoop on the latest  scandal . There's a lot of people who want to tear you down and are willing to play dirty, but try not to let it get to you. It's not personal, it's business.  Features  Decide how to  deal with crises  including gossip, vandalism, stalkers, or threats directed at your agency and the pop idols you manage. Manage relationships  between the different idols in your group, as you deal with cliques, internal feuds, and bullying. Grow your fanbase  by varying your tactics and appealing to a wide variety of demographics. Produce singles , hold concerts, organize huge TV events and overseas tours to capitalize on your group's popularity and bring in revenue. Develop your agency's building . Start with simple offices and dance rooms to produce content and train your idols, and end with your own cafe and theater to create a steady stream of revenue.  Hire and train staffers  to help deal with logistics and keep your agency running smoothly. Discover substories  - chains of events and visual novel segments, many of which are triggered by your play style. Each substory can play out in multiple different ways based on your decisions, often causing serious consequences for your playthrough.

As of this year, all the hospitals in the city have been privatized, as are 89% of all apartments, the transit network, the police force and of course, the water. For all intents and purposes, the only part of the city the city hall controls, is the city hall building itself and even there the private sector provides security. For the most part the transition has been peaceful and individual protests have died out quickly or been effectively countered by friendly news networks. The amount of violence has been entirely acceptable. However, resistance cells dedicated explicitly to halting corporate plans have formed. The leaders for the most significant one are listed below.  NO. 1 LACE, JOSEPHINE  NO. 2 JANIS, RANI  NO. 3 MATURANA, NORBERT, DR.  It is the belief of the board that, if not dealt with, this group could pose a serious problem to most if not all the various private industries and their extensive control over public affairs. So far the group has been targeting the water industry, attacking profits by stealing water and redistributing it to the lower classes. The security industry and the hospital industry have agreed with us that all three must be eliminated for the greater good.    Considering the recent violent incident that left n. 1 hospitalized, n. 2 homeless and both hell bent on revenge, the board advices that discretion and efficiency be the key words to any future steps to remove this threat.

"The special Action RPG game where are no heroes and worlds to save, no sandboxes or just corridor story. Its an untypical role-playing story-adventure in the culture-oriented cold-blooded setting that has an emphasis on non-hardcore&still fun realism and has multiple strange but original endings during all story through.   Yes, the graphics are old school like but each location was custom pictured, with enthusiasm and for some of us this graphics' style is actually the point. We also know that the controls are a bit unexpected, but they are really comforted when you used to it.   And now the last but not the least, if you know how common RPG Maker game mostly looks like - this is the list of ARENA's features and each of them could be that ""because"" you are searching for: 1. Action fighting system. Scrolls, range' and melee' weapon types included. 2. Hunger-thirst-rest system. It cares that you don't think your character is a biorobot. 3. Kind of open world. Locations here as well as its inhabitants are part of the setting and you are the only one who can make them part of the story. So walk freely, there is gameplay besides the story. 4. Crafting system. Its Gothic like and comprises food and weapon crafting. 5. Multiple story endings. According to the game designer, you have the main character's purpose and the obvious way to achieve it. Like you usually do. But this time you are the mind controller here, so who says the story must end one way?

Some say it is so enormous - that the character could die  99  times before reaches all of its' rooms.  20  times from mobs,  30  from other players,  40  from hunger or thirst, and  9  - from the old age. All we know - it definitely would be fun and surprising anyway.  2.  Custom  character that could belong to one of  4  classes. Each with  its own  difficulty and preferable  game style ,  for real (because they are actually all the same when it is about weapon type effectiveness. The differences is much more interesting).  3.  Two  game mods.   4.  Survival  system.  5.  Plenty of bloody cold  weapons , as well as  opponents  and  monsters .",Action||Adventure||Survival,Action RPG||Dungeon Crawler||RPG Maker,Chronicles and Fables: Labyrinth,samuelsattic.itch.io/labyrinth

It's up to you to discover their motivations for driving along the coast of Italy and away from their homes.

Join us on our team's   Discord  to chat with the devs and our friends who made this demo possible!  Tallara had never set foot on the ground, until he enlisted in the Spirelands Kingdom's Navy. Dispatched aboard the Airship  Erebus , he hoped to drop in, throw some wind magic around, and return home to a life of luxury, a war hero. Instead, he's assigned to Flanker Section 33 where he's made to sweep the floors of the flanker berth, among other equally unheroic assignments.   On the frozen continent below, the Strikers of the Illanian Guard push back against a powerful invading army known as the Shuvur. With their brutal ice magic, the enemy has made significant advances into Illanian territory, devastating everything in their path.   Week after week, Tallara is left behind, deemed unready for combat. But strange events begin to unfold aboard the Erebus and his luck takes a turn when he, and two other misfits, Laverna and Magnus, are called to duty under a mysterious new squad leader, a beautiful Striker named Iris. Together, the four of them will dive from safety of the airship into the frozen world below on a special mission to end the war and reclaim their lost world.

"Is there anything that isn't in this game?  - several Twitter users   Sm4R is a crazy singleplayer 2D sidescroller RPG where you hunt monsters, complete quests, party up with other (bot)players and play minigames. By doing that you collect experience points and level up to increase your stats and skills. Find rare items and upgrade them to the max to become #1 of all players in your personal offline Sm4R world! Sm4R is a satire of typical MMORPG grinders. You'll be involved in varied and weird stories that may or may not remind you of your personal MMO experience.   Sm4R features: - Over 60 maps containing more than 300 unique monsters - 12 boss monster maps - 5 special maps with many diverse minigames (for example a trading card battle arena) - Over 1300 unique items to equip and activate - Over 500 different skills to learn - 150 levels (each level unlocks new items and skills)   This demo version is limited to level 30 . However there is a way to increase the limit to level 50 which talented players who like challenges will find out.  The fastest Closed Beta tester reached level 30 after 5:47 hours. And there is even more to explore in the demo after that. Have fun!  The full version will be availlable in late 2019   If the game crashes after the EULA screen, try to set compatibilityMode=1 in the settings.ini or make sure VC++ redist 2013 is installed on your PC. (I think this problem only appears on a few Windows XP/Vista/7 machines where that software is not installed by default). And report any bugs you find! I'll fix them for the next patch.

"A prototype/teaser demo for Scrap Story, an upcoming paper RPG. In this demo, the focus is on platforming and exploration.   This is my first game, so I am not really sure what to say here... I will try to put more details here over time.  As a prototype, there WILL be bugs. So please let me know what kind of bugs you find. Any feedback/critiques are greatly appreciated! Please note that any changes stated in the devlogs are NOT reflected in this teaser demo!  An xbox controller is highly recommended, but the game will work with keyboard controls. Other controllers/gamepads are not recommended and probably will not even work! Also note that if you use an xbox controller, by default ""A"" and ""B"" are inverted, which may cause some confusion. You can change that in the application startup dialogue box when you first click open the game. There will be in game button mapping in the future!  (Linux version tested on Ubuntu 18.10 64bit)  Minimum System Requirements :  Dual Core CPU  DX10 GPU(I am using a GeForce 9600GT, which in most cases is good enough!)  2GB RAM   -FAQ-  -May I stream or make a video about your game?  Yup! I would love to tune in sometime too :)  - Is there a Discord server for the game?  Not yet, but I am looking into starting one!  -Do you have a Patreon or plan on doing a Kickstarter?  Not yet, but I would love to offer goodies and rewards for those that want to support the project financially. Art, tutorials, play testing, behind the scenes looks, chances to get your own ideas, art, characters, etc in the game... are some ideas I have.  -Will the game be coming to console?  It is very hard to say at this point. I would love to see the game on PS4/Switch, but there are alot of things to consider. If it does happen, it wont be until some decent amount of time after the initial PC release.  -Will the game be on Steam?  Yup, I will be putting the game on Steam, unless for some reason they do not allow the game on their platform.  -What engine are you using?  I am Uniting ;)  -Cool demo, but what happens now?  Another demo is underway! Only this time it will be more like a short game. It will feature all or most game mechanics including battles, leveling up, item collecting, more in depth NPC interactions, more thought out puzzles, a short spin off story, polished platforming, and mini games! I am aiming for May/June, but that will probably change.  -Is there a projected release date for the full game?  Pretty hard to say, I would like the game to be released Q1 2021, but still too early to determine. By doing this next demo, it will better help me project a release date, since the next demo will be about the same length as one of the chapters from the main game.",,,Scrap Story Teaser Demo,scrap-paper-dev.itch.io/scrap-story

"Senile Showdown: Arthfightus  ""Senile Showdown: Arthfightus""  is the result of a week-long sprint. A self-imposed personal game jam from us here at the Scythe Dev Team. It's a game within a game.  Remember the dev room in the garage at King's Comfort? This is what they were working on!  This crazy, ragdoll focused first person beat-em'-up takes place inside a retirement home. Fight your way past other old-folks, caretakers and some surprise guests as you try your best to escape!   Ragdoll physics!  Jon of the Shred OST! Foley Sound Design that left bruises on our sound guy! Breakable objects! Scythe Saga Universe Tie-Ins! Raunchy comedy! A special satirical news report, ""Violence in Videogames,"" featuring the voice work of Kyle Brauch! All of the  bugs  charm of a game finished inside of a week!  Developed inside of a week,  Senile Showdown: Arthfightus  served as a much needed palette cleanser. As we moved onto a new stage of development with  Walls Closing In , we needed a break. A momentary task to take us away, for a moment, from the unrelenting horror, gore, and bleak atmosphere of  WCI .  (Ever hear about Jack Nicholson going a bit crazy when he played the Joker? We're gonna assume that's legitimate.)  We recommend a higher end PC to play, as there's thousands of physics calculations happening at once. A modern GPU and CPU should be sufficient.  How To Play:  WASD - Movement  Left Click | Right Click - Left & Right Punch  F - Kick!  Shift - Sprint  Ctrl - Crouch  Space - Jump   The goal of the game is to accumulate the highest score possible before reaching the end. But beware, one slip and you could break a hip... Er, lose your score.   The score is multiplied by destruction. So smash those young whippersnappers into submission!   Senile Showdown: Arthfightus  has nods and Easter Eggs to many great fighting games in the past...well, as much as we could manage inside of a week. If there's enough interest, we can foresee this game getting some additional content.   If you like what you see, leave some feedback! We'll be developing much deeper 1st person fighting games based in the future, and welcome all feedback! Jump on our discord ( discord.gg/scythesaga ) and let your voice be heard! Stay tuned...  And most importantly  POST YOUR HIGH SCORES!  The game automatically takes a screenshot of your high score (assuming you beat the game!), check the root folder of the games files, we wanna see what you can do!",Action||Fighting,Arcade||Beat 'em up||Comedy||First-Person||Funny||Retro||Singleplayer||Unity,Senile Showdown: Arthfightus,scythedevteam.itch.io/senile-showdown-arthfightus

"Heroes of Shaola is a story-driven RPG set in a medieval fantasy world. You are a young nobleman trying to survive in a corrupt world filled with humor and political incorrectness, as opposing factions and individuals trying to outwit each other.  Synopsis  Zenman Empire is the largest nation in the world. It is located in the central region and surrounded by the bloodthirsty Martia Kingdom (formerly the Martia Tribes) in the north, the deceptively powerful Amazail Kingdom in the south, and the unpredictable House Lagidis in the west.  	Each year, the vassal factions must pay a tribute with gifts, weapons, women, and gold to Zenman Empire.  	Its capital city, Zalumi, has been protected by the four most powerful noble families. Those four families are the 	 Sutherlands , the Pantelakos, the Totens, and the Rileys.  	One morning, Leonardo, the only child of the Sutherlands, was nowhere to be found. His mysterious disappearance shocked the nation.  	Meanwhile, in the north, Martia Kingdom has been staring at Zalumi for years. The Amazailians are also lurking around from the south.  	Both are growing tired of being a vassal nation. They are tiring of paying tributes to Zenman Empire.  	They have been watching Zalumi like a hawk, waiting for a chance to take action.  	Sources from Iron Eagle, the mysterious organization from Zuda Kingdom, revealed that Martia and Amazail have been trying to form an alliance.  	The once great Zenman Empire is suddenly facing two big threats from the north and south.  	Characteristics and Features  An engaging story with unexpected plot twists. Zelda-like jumps, slash bushes, find secret treasures, explore hidden areas. Final Fantasy-like battle system, but with visible enemies. No random encounters or invisible monsters. Bandits and aggressive beasts will approach you. Less aggressive opponents will leave you alone, unless you initiate the attack.  Grinding is unnecessary. All you need is to be careful with  each decision, look out for quests and hidden secrets, manage your money (buy/sell) wisely, and use your skill, items, and potions carefully. The plots and dialogues are managed carefully in order to bring each character to life. No Game Over.We all know how much time we spent dying on games and it's the most frustrating thing in the world. There is good replay value with multiple endings based on many variables, including dialogue choices and subtle triggers. The game is portable, no installation required to play. It is  DRM-free, no registration, activation or online connection required to play, and it is completely Ad-free. Simply unzip, open the game folder and play the game on any Windows PC.   Inspirations  The stories, settings and gameplay that have influenced the making of this game are:  • Game of Thrones and the novel A Song of Ice and Fire.  • The Middle-Earth universe from The Lord of the Rings trilogy.  • Zelda series and some aspect of the gameplay, rewards, secrets, hidden areas.  • Norse/Germanic and Japanese mythology.  • European and Asian medieval history.

"The year 20XX The Earth is under attack by ALIENS.  ALIENS with MISSILES  Our scientists can't science fast enough.  Our ninjas can't ninja high enough.  only ONE MAN is both a rocket-scientist AND a ninja.. . NINJECTORY is a reimagining of 1980's classic, but rather boring, Missile Command.  Missile rain down on the city below and you have to zip around on your jetpack and hit them with your sword to save humanity.  This is my #devtober 2019 entry.  It's a playable demo of a tutorial and 10 levels ending in a (very WIP) ""boss fight.""  I hope you enjoy it. Install instructions 10 level demo!  Free to download!  Complete a survey afterward (accessed from the game's title page) to earn another build with an Endless Mode.   Game display is currently only formatted for 1920x1080.  I know, I know, I really should've planned ahead.  My bad, honestly.  I'm working on it!  In the meantime the game will launch in a 1920x1080 window. You can play at other resolutions and the basic gameplay should be fine, but the game's GUI is gunna get  weird  if your screen is smaller than 1920x1080. I feel the game plays best with an XBONE controller, but I have implemented mouse controls and you're welcome to give them a shot.

You can follow the progress on  Facebook  Twitter  Or join the community on  Discord Game Description:  As the youngest heir of an ancient bloodline of proud Monster Keepers, you step out into the world to follow in your ancestors' footsteps. You will gather a party of monsters to grow and train. Meanwhile, a series of unsettling events worries the experienced Keepers of the Monster Sanctuary. This is the beginning of a journey to unravel the cause of this mystery that threatens the peace between humans and monsters.  Monster Sanctuary is the idea of combining monster collecting, turn based combat and metroidvania-like exploration. Any monster you encounter can become a part of your own party. Additional monsters provide a lot of tactical options in combat or allow you to overcome certain obstacles to explore new areas.  Every monster has a unique skill tree. This lets you individualize your monster to pursue different strategies. Feeding and equipping your monsters to improve their stats further emphasizes this aspect.  The combo system gives additional depth to the combat. Each individual hit increases the damage of the next moves within the same combat turn. The loot system challenges you to find the quickest and most efficient way to end a battle - rewarding you with better loot.

"IMPORTANT NEWS 13/11/19: We did just upload for the first time the demo build of the current beta.  It features approximately 2 hours of gameplay in Campaign and Arcade mode (6 maps, including our workbench map with all units and buildings testable). Keep in mind that the game is still in a beta stage, therefore, while tested, there is still several minor issues to be fixed.  The full beta is accessible from our official  Discord Server .   Even before we mention what Empires in Ruins is and why it is so, a few words about the current state of the game build.  The build available is a battle map-only beta (it has one map, one terrain, and none of the 4X or management part). It is still rough, but it has everything the final map engine will have in, minus a lot of polishing.  Having EVERYTHING in since the first start of the game might seem overwhelming, but at this stage we really need to test it all. Later on, in the game, you will unlock progressively towers, abilities, new enemies, etc.  What we would now really need from you guys is feedback. All sort of it, about everything, and if you like what we did here, join our community so to come along with us in the last months of work to get Empires in Ruins finally done.

Empire In Ruins presents a new take at strategy by merging the Tower Defense genre's detailed, recognizable gameplay with elements of Turn-Based Empire Management, in a hybrid never before seen.  Conquer, build, defend and lead the grumpy Sgt. Hans Heimer in his own personal vendetta against ""the system"".  KEY FEATURES  Plot driven campaign - betrayals, diplomacy and nasty twists Turn based strategy - quell the rebellion, kick back the enemy and restore the law. Empire management - conquer back the provinces, strengthen your command, chose your best governors and grant your military campaign a steady flow of resources Arcade play mode. Because... FIGHT! Tower defense-based combat - fight your battles in a new, advanced tower defense style that winks at advanced real time strategy Dark humor, dark humor everywhere! - Don't smile, it's punishable. Folk metal original soundtrack -  https://soundcloud.com/reddewhellpipes   In a corrupted little Principality governed by spruced up popinjays, snobby clergymen and power greedy army officers, something just happened. A god forgotten borderland, the Western Marches, just got inflamed with rebellion, cutting every contact with the capital and declaring independence.  And in such a critical moment, who to send in order to quell the rebellion if not a grumpy alcoholic sergeant with discipline problems and bad bad temper?  Why him? And what is the neighboring kingom, the Krovans, plotting to do with the Principality of Koth?   Empires in Ruins is composed of two main parts. The turn based Main Map, where the campaign develops and you are called to managed the conquered provinces and the Battlefield, where the real time blood flows and you need to kick the enemy in the arse or be the one kicked.   Empires in Ruins whole plot-driven campaign of turn based strategy and empire building, is managed in the main map. Through it you will access the single combat maps (according to the plot flow or in order to defend/replay maps), manage diplomacy and access the single province to improve or check their assets and governors.   Expand, fortify and expand further taking advantage of the conquered provinces reach and infrastructures. Improve the regions' production, increase the flow of resources to fund your brutal military campaign. Don't expect much help from above. Handle diplomacy - Like a bull in a china shop. Assign trusted men to govern the regions. Expect betrayals or hang them before that. Manage research - More than 100 technologies to research.   Battles are fought in real time, using a hybrid of Tower Defense and RTS mechanics.   COMBAT MAP FEATURES Erect your buildings in real time. Avoid getting your workers killed if they walk the wrong path 17 towers with unique feats Manage resources in battle Combine the special abilities of your towers to obtain even deadlier effects (Ever tried a flaming arrow on an oil covered enemy?) Manage multiple resources, production and special buildings Deploy Officers to command and enhance your battlefield forces Beware of nasty, canny enemies. They will open new unexpected paths, sabotage your towers, blow your production and get through your defenses in surprising ways. Ground, air, water, amphibian and secret enemies paths to defend against.    The path to victory is paved with opponents with badly planned research trees. [cit. Gottfried Megler]  Few things make progression in a game as interesting as unlocking new technologies to empower your troops, weapons and economies.

Death traps are everywhere, some need to be deactivated, some can be avoided, and some are simply impossible to pass without dying.   But death wasn't the end. Every time she died, a strange machine brings her back to life.   It becomes clear that the only way for her to move forward through these horrible tests... is to die over and over again.  Death and Progress is a light horror game filled with puzzles and traps inspired by other Japanese horror RPG like Witch's House and Ib. Death is around every corner, but dying is not necessarily a bad thing, and sometimes it is the only way to proceed. Can you find your way through the traps?  WARNING: This game includes depictions of suicide (namely some puzzles requires the player character to kill themselves to proceed). There are also frequent scenes of blood and gore. Player discretion is advised.  My submission for the third Extra Credit Game Jam with the theme ""Cycle"". As the title suggests, this is the cycle of dying and making progress. It was pretty well received so I decided to make a full game with this concept, and this is now the demo for said game.   - Find your way out through a series of puzzles and traps  - Three stages with varying environments  - Four different endings  - Unique death traps with different solutions  - Hidden solutions that opens up new ways to avoid traps  - Replay the levels for clues to escape a horrible fate  Tip: You can turn on always run from the main menu.

"Dungeonlike is a traditional roguelike dungeon crawler. Turn based, with tile graphics, randomisation, and a ton of character customisation, as well as an advanced health and ability system.  Your task is to slay Durgaz, the chief of Orcs who resides at the bottom of an underground fortress. At least, that is the official agenda. In reality, your task is to turn this dungeon into a gallery of orcish guts and remains.  Randomised dungeon levels. Randomised enemy equipment. Open world, although it's still quite small and empty at this stage. 6 races to choose from. Over 40 attacks and spells to end your foes. Over 100 items to utilise. About 50 randomly applied enchants which can further empower your items. Slash & Stab! Weapons often provide more than one way of slamming them against those who get in your way. Health and inventory system fully based on body parts.  Cut off their legs, then crush their skulls! Design your own versions of spells and techniques. Tame the magic, master the steel! Discover hidden rooms with treasure.  Full built-in wiki, aka. Dungeonpedia. Install instructions Windows  Double click the downloaded archive to exctract all files, can be anywhere. Go to game folders and launch the game by double clicking Dungeonlike.exe, the one with a kobold icon!  Linux  In order to run Dungeonlike under Linux, you will first require mono libraries, namely ""mono-runtime"". On Ubuntu this boils down to running ""sudo apt-get install mono-runtime"". Although that has worked on my machine, I've hear people saying that they had to install ""mono-complete"" instead, give that a shot if the above doesn't work right off the bat. Once you have mono, navigate to the game folder and run the game with ""mono Dungeonlike.exe"".  Linux compatibility is a bit experimental at the moment, but I didn't have any problems running it on my old Ubuntu laptop once mono was installed.",Role Playing,2D||Dark Fantasy||Dungeon Crawler||Fantasy||Perma Death||Roguelike||Turn-Based Combat,Dungeonlike,sheriour.itch.io/dungeonlike
"Sadie is a young woman standing at one of life's early crossroads - namely, figuring out what to do with the rest of it. Ambivalent about her career aspirations and recovering from a recent breakup, she is a soul adrift in a sea of uncertainty. But hey, at least she has her dogs for emotional support, quirky as they are. If only they were people, capable of really understanding...  As the old saying goes, be careful what you wish for.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Paws & Effect  features a small, but colorful cast of characters, including but not limited to the following:  The Unwitting Heroine (Default Name: Sadie) An aspiring lawyer, Sadie is intelligent and caring, albeit with a sardonic impulse. She's unsure about her life's direction -- and doubly so when the whole thing goes off the rails. Beset by problems new and old, how will she keep it together? The Best Friend (Forever Name: Diya) Sadie's good friend from college, Diya is just as ready to help out as she is to throw shade. With her sharp instincts, she knows something is up - and she won't let Sadie leave her in the dark about her new ""friends"". Whether she can handle the truth is another matter... The Ex-Boyfriend (Forever Name: Vincent) Sadie is still recovering from her break-up with Vincent, her skinny Australian boyfriend for the last year. Things seemed to be great until they discovered their diverging opinions about keeping pets, which prompted the separation, but old flames sometimes burn longest... assuming her dogs don't snuff it out. The Lonely Prince (Default Name: Peaches)  With a subdued demeanor and thoughtful gaze, Peaches is the more intellectual-seeming of Sadie's dog duo. Or maybe he just has the lax hubris of a creature that's been spoiled with treats and cuddles. He doesn't really care either way. The Warrior Princess (Default Name: Pecan)  Intensely loyal and obviously needy, Pecan is a girl's best friend - as long as you stay out of her war path. Her obsessive love for Sadie is matched only by her distaste for Peaches, but her true fixation is the sky and all the evil it harbors. Y'know, birds, planes,  space .   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   A lot! Since its submission to NaNoRenO 2016,  Paws & Effect  has received substantial changes, including:  A complete rebuilding inside a new engine (from Novelty to TyranoBuilder) Completely new, hand-drawn backgrounds A new logo and branding Completely redrawn character sprites Completely revamped music and sound effects A host of animated details New characters Revised and expanded scenes A focused number of choice options that meaningfully affect in-game events Over 50,000 words across multiple paths and 5 distinct endings A robust episode and choice select feature Improved technical stability Several hundred ""light"" voice clips from professional voice-actors Greater platform spread (browser, Windows, Mac, and hopefully mobile)    And the list goes on! But don't take our word for it - give the new demo a spin to see our long toil in action.  We thank everyone who has supported us for the last three years! We're excited to present a new and improved  Paws & Effect  and hope that you find the game relatable, heartwarming and fun. As always, we welcome your thoughts and feedback.

"A New Perspective on a Classic Adventure  2004. It was the year when millions of players assumed the role of rookie cop-turned-secret agent Leon S. Kennedy as he traveled to rural Spain in pursuit of Ashley Graham, the president's missing daughter. A watershed moment in gaming, Resident Evil 4 was a reinvention of both its series and its genre - not to mention one hell of a party.    More importantly, Leon had  amazing  hair. Oh, and he flipped over lasers. For many, he entered the hallowed halls of video game heartthrobs in the same way he crashed through two-story windows: suddenly and with swag.    But we all know Leon's story. What about Ashley's? For the players of Resident Evil 4, she is, at best, an objective; at worst, a liability. A human cog in a well-oiled gameplay machine. But what if she was more than that? What if she was an interesting person, thrust into a crazy world with crazier men who run the gamut from hottie to hellspawn? How would she narrate this nightmare and who would she actually fall for?    Wonder no more. This is her story. This is  RE4: Otome Edition.     Relive the events of Resident Evil 4, faithfully recreated from Ashley's perspective - and with exactly as much absurdity as that entails!   Kindle your relationship with a host of eligible bachelors, including the stoic Leon, the mysterious Luis, the evasive Merchant, or perhaps even the conniving Lord Saddler!*   Discover what happened to Ashley in the scenes you never saw, such as her initial kidnapping.   Make decisions that leave you questioning whether you're really in control!

"Your ship had to make an emergency landing and you are now shipwrecked! The goal of the game is to repair your ship but also survive on your new planet. You must collect resources to progress further. The game doesn't end when you finally repair your ship but has another goal. How will you play shipwreck?   Shipwreck has drop in / drop out style multiplayer. Doesn't require a registration, no personal information is collected, and compliances with GDPR. Create a new game, supply the name you want to be in the game and done. When creating a new game, you could choose your old name OR could create a new name.   The current state of the game?  The current state of the game has the main core features of building, crafting, and destroying tiles.   Shipwreck has procedural map generation. Each map will generate different from player to player. The map will slowly grow over time and the longer you play, the more you can build. The game will try to keep a large amount of tiles so you can always build.  In order to harvest resources, or gain research will need workers in those buildings.  Supplying more villagers in a building will increase the amount you could gain from that building.  The game will be different every time you play! One game may have lots of combat as another game may have lots of floods and fires. The ai event director will try to balance the events over a long period of gameplay.  The game has over 20+ types of things to research. Those types of research could be new housing, factories, or new resources.  The game has multiplayer features too! Can interact with other players and can create, cancel, or purchase from the in-game auction system. This gives the ability to purchase or sell items of your choosing. The game has an open style currency system. You could sell auctions based on coins but you can also sell auctions based on another resource.   Plans for this year?  The game will have many styles of combat. Instead of sending large amount of combat ships, could send raid or slave ships. A raid ship will go after resources and a slave ship will go after colonists.  The game will have ping ships to find other planets or life forms. When a solar system is pinged, will have the ability to send research ships to find other players and gain planet research. Planet research can sold in the auction or be used to migrate to that planet.  Trade routes will have another aspect of trade. Trade routes will give the ability to accept trade licenses. Those licenses require a resource as the licensee will give a resource in return. Not all trade licenses will be player controlled but they could be faction controlled.  Planet research is required to live on other planets. It is not the best idea to land on an unknown planet with a different atmosphere. Research points can be sold auction or can be used for building types of that planet. Will contain over five planet types that will be randomly chosen when generating a new map.  More multiplayer interactions and multiplayer features. The shipwreck universe can be controlled by other factions and those ares will have large amounts of resources or research that cannot be found elsewhere. Not only areas of space can be controlled but planets can be controlled too!  Shipwreck will have two different types of contacts; player contacts and faction contacts. The player contacts can set up new trade routes to that player. Faction have the same abilities as player contacts but done differently. You don't directly contact the leaders of that faction instead you are pointed to a representative of that faction.  Factions are similar to a guild but with more. Any player can create a faction but only a few will survive in shipwreck because of faction disputes, faction vs faction, or spy/sabotage. When creating a faction, you are able to create your own faction logo. That logo is a 32x32 drawable pixel grid of your own faction logo. The faction will have the ability to create faction ranks of leadership and leadership control within those ranks. Not all factions are based on one group but factions can align their faction to other faction.  Feedback!  All feedback is very important. Currently gained lots of feedback to improve the game.

"Circadian Dice is a game inspired by single-player deck-building games, but instead of upgrading a deck, you build up a set of dice!  Overview  A cosmic entity has twisted time into an endless cycle. By observing the repeating patterns, the entity intends to destroy all uncertainty and ultimately control reality.  In Circadian Dice, you control a group of heroes that have managed to step outside this unnatural cycle, and are now setting out to find and destroy its source. You will need to overcome a series of skirmishes by upgrading your dice to bend chance in your favor, and strategically using your limited resources to defeat your enemies.   While the heroes and their dice are restored to normal after each scenario (whether they die or succeed), any upgrades, relics, abilities, and modifiers that you have unlocked persist - so your tools are constantly improving! The better you perform in battle, the quicker you will build your arsenal and progress through the game towards your ultimate goal to break the loop and save  the universe.  Features  A game about probability manipulation and combo crafting: shape 6-sided dice into weapons of destruction, generators of wealth, magic conduits, or stat-boosting machines! 11 scenarios, available in Normal and Hard Mode. In Hard Mode, each scenario is significantly changed with new enemies, secrets, and challenges! Unlockable  Endless  and  Campaign  (""roguelite"") modes that turn the game from a skirmish-based adventure into an intense survival challenge. 6 different heroes with unique characteristics and play styles. 36 unlockable and equippable  Relics  that provide your hero with new abilities, change your stats, and give you game-warping bonuses. 60 different abilities that strengthen your hero, manipulate your dice, or damage your enemies. A semi-random upgrade mechanic for each scenario and hero, that ensures new combo opportunities every time you play. 55 enemies and 23 bosses, each with different characteristics and abilities. (Almost) every enemy can be captured in your dice to give you bonuses and new attacks based on the enemy's attributes! Rare random enemy mutations that can either make your adventure harder, or be turned to your benefit. Built for quick pick-up-and-play sessions: each scenario takes between 10 and 30 minutes to play, and is designed as a stand-alone challenge. High replayability: random mutators, semi-random upgrade opportunities, and near-infinite combo possibilities makes each run of a scenario unique!

Hovey  ""I loved the quirky but fantastic hand-painted visuals, the gruff, cynical humour.""  --Gaming Respawn  ""Indie Game of The Year 2017"" Top 100 Finalist, Top 3 point-and-clicks  --IndieDB     Neofeud is a Dystopic Cyberpunk adventure game in the vein of Blade Runner, but with an overlay of Game of Thrones-like political intrigue, and 1366x768, hand-painted, stylized visuals.    The art, stories and gameplay of Neofeud are a reflection of my experiences as a STEM teacher for the underserved youth of Honolulu’s inner city. Teaching robotics, programming, and sustainability is an often difficult, stressful, and even Kafka-esque endeavor -- being in one of the richest, most beautiful places on Earth, yet dealing with families with working parents, who are living out of a van, or sleeping on the street. It is hard trying to keep the kids out of gangs, off of drugs, and on a path towards better opportunities, such as the ones I had growing up in a slum area of paradise while going to an upscale private school. I made Neofeud to be a fun and engaging game in and of itself, but I also wanted the player to think about the society in which we live, as well as the one which we may be heading toward if nothing is done.    Synopsis:   2033 - We create AI. Sentient robots arrive, but not as our Terminator overlords or our Singularity saviors -- conscious machines are humanity's unwanted bastard children. A few are geniuses who design flying cars, beat cancer, invent teleportation, but millions of defective prototypes roll out of factories -- classified as ""mentally challenged"", ""motivationally-challenged"", ""criminally-inclined"". Legally conscious, but struggling to find work, these ""Defectives"" are shuffled through public housing and welfare assistance, straining the already overburdened back of the meager social safety net. The robots who don't end up in prison are dumped, as a last resort, into a massive landfill known as ""The Pile"".   Humans engage in perfection of their species -- or at least the powerful and well-connected -- genetically engineering children with human and animal DNA. The failed eugenics experiment ""Frankenpeople"" are discarded into ""The Pile"" as well. The new dynasties, the ""Neofeudal Lords"", live in towering neon glass castles, shuttle around in pristine nanotech-enabled pods, minds and bodies full of cyberware, spending most of their time taking selfies and ""optimizing their monetization schemes"". A race of supermen concerned only with their own status, their prestige, their success. Where machines have become all too flawed and human, people have become flawless, perfect, cold machines.   Karl Carbon is an ex-cop, dishonorably discharged from Coastlandia PD for disobeying an order to shoot an unarmed sentient humanoid. Karl is exiled to ""The Pile"" as a lowly social worker. There he counsels gangbanging foster-kid robots and confiscates chimera-children from deadbeat half-wolf parents. Till one day a case goes horribly sideways and Karl is drawn into a sordid conspiracy that could threaten the strained fabric of Human-Robot-Hybrid civilization -- or save it.  	 FEATURES    	 15+ hours of gameplay.  An original dystopic sci-fi world and story that will (hopefully) be compelling and stimulate thought about our present society and future.  Over 76,000 words of voice acted dialog.

Growing up Native Hawaiian in Honolulu, Hawaii, he experienced a somewhat 'postmodern' and dissonant existence of clashing cultures, peoples, and extreme inequality.

"About the Experience:  A game without meaning. A game nobody should play.  A clock, a piano and a girl. What do they all mean?  What is meaning, anyway? What has meaning? Do you have one? A path, a goal, something determined, pre-determined? A light to follow?  Discover a world filled with fear and loneliness. A world where despair breathes and hope dies. A world about you, about us. A world about humanity and about life.  If you had a choice, which one would you make?  There is more to this experience than meets the eye. You have been warned.    About the Development:  This is a  walking simulator  I've been working on here and there for the past year or so. I wanted to find a way to express how I felt in my darkest times, and I couldn't find any better than an interactive experience. This is a passion project. It is also my first attempt at making a game by myself from scratch.  The Experience should take between 45min to one hour to complete.  This game is  not  for everyone. This is a tale with little meaning and little hope, born from months of uncertainty and dark thoughts. The gameplay is close to non-existent, and the graphics are little more than boxes and shadows.  Hopefully, this game will open doors for people who need it, give a good scare for those who so desire, and make some others think.  Please leave a rating, comment or share the word around if you enjoyed this experience!    Warnings:  This game explores themes such as depression, anxiety, verbal abuse, manipulative control, and suicide. This game could potentially trigger epilepsy attacks and has some nasty jump scares. Play at your own risk.  Since I was working alone on this game, and even though I tested it countless times,  bugs are entirely possible . If you encounter one, please contact me, and I'll try to fix it asap!  This game will manipulate some files and gather some data from your computer. If you do not feel comfortable with this, do not play it.  Always follow the light. And never look back.   Let's Plays Playlist:  Gameplays of WTDC  As some people have asked me, it is authorized, and even greatly encouraged, to stream/record/share this experience.

"Cake Kills Candy was made in a week. Its an arcade platform shooter with procedural generated levels. Stomp and shoot enemies. Score points for getting the key to the door. Bonuses for health and not shooting in a level reward you for strategy over dumb shooting. High score is kept, great with a controller and there are a slew of settings.  QUICK FEATURES   - Procedural generated levels  - Arcade scoring system based on level completion - Happy environment of chocolate and candy canes  - 5 guns - Giant mega boss fight every 10 levels (11, 21, 31 and so on)  - Mega Man - ish play style with bigger guns - Full Controller Support  GAME HISTORY Made for the Hamjam 2 with a cake theme. Then a day before the game jam ended I noticed a different game jam with a candy theme. Lucky for us we always had the idea of cake kills candy. Two week long game jams with one game.  UPDATES:  Version 1.9 (the boss jam)   - Added huge boss fight.  - Added 3 new tile sets (root beer + cotton candy + orange cream filled bar)  - Added version numbers.  - Added more sound effects.  - Modified a lot of the game to enhance minor details.  - Modified enemy parts and enemy jam.  - Modified candy cane shotgun to be more useful.  - Modified level system to generate easier maps in the starting room.  - Modified music volume so the sound effects stand out more when volume and sound levels are at even percentages.  - Fixed an issue when on rare occasion the enemies falling to the ground would snap to the ground rather than fall to the ground.  Version 1.5 - 1.8 (after the original cake & candy jams)  - Added company logo. - Modified how the backgrounds are generated to hopefully fix an issue. - Added a low bounce stomp if you hold down when hopping on an enemy. - Fixed title menu to be more consistent and always show tiles rather than the occassional background. - Fixed an issue where the player sprite would appear several times instead of once. - Added a method to turn off controller support in the options to comply for a game jam. The game can still auto detect if you are playing on a controller or keyboard.  - Added a different HUD for life and weapon ammo..  - Fixed a major crash caused by incorrect level loading (this would happen once for each new player).  - Fixed doors appearing too high up on larger levels.  - Modified temporary file cleanup. - Fixed a specific crash in windowed mode where the game would somehow forget the levels.  - Fixed visual issue with the K in the font. - Added loading screen. Depending on your computer's processor it will be either a blink or a wait.  - Added larger variety to floor tile sets (wider and taller tiles).  - Fixed background tiles not showing up on the first screen of larger rooms.  - Fixed negative point bonus.  - Fixed candy cane text.  - Fixed rare issue where enemies could damage the player while being pulled into the door.  - Modified the single room generation to prevent a more challenging room from appearing first.  - Fixed keys from spawning too high to jump in the larger maps.  Version 1.0 - 1.4 (during the first 2 jams)   - Added more diversity with the tilesets just before the deadline. There are now 7 tilesets. - Removed an exploit to switch weapons. - Fixed a crash with adjusting music volume in the options. - Fixed a rare crash relating to how a level is generated (hopefully).  - Fixed how the game cleans up temporary files.

About  The List is a light-hearted adventure game with simple platforming, a few minigames, and a focus on dialogue. It should take 2-3 hours to finish. Due to the length, and amount of reading, I recommend playing it over multiple sessions.  Should you need help progressing in the game, or if want to make sure you find every item, there is an extensive walkthrough included.  Linux Compatibility  You can play The List on Linux using  WINE ! The game has been completely playtested using WINE on Ubuntu.  If you are using 64-bit Linux, and the game starts without any sound, you might be missing 32-bit libraries for your default sound device. As a common example, if your setup is PulseAudio on 64-bit Debian/Ubuntu, you can install 32-bit libraries using the apt-get utility: apt-get install libpulse0:i386  Credits  The List is a game by Nikki Bee.

Sylvius has become obsessed by a theory that there exists a “hungry dimension” parallel to our own which throughout history has swallowed up people, things and even places. He has studied hundreds if not thousands of cases dating from earliest antiquity to the present day (September 26, 1988). He’s published two books and gives somewhat controversial lectures on the subject.  Recently Sylvius’ obsession has reached fever pitch. He believes that through his efforts he has discovered the exact geographical location where the border between this dimension and our own is thinnest. Against the advice of his peers he has used all his research funding to finance an expedition to the Gehensk Autonomous Okrug in northeast Russia.  At the dig site Sylvius becomes separated from the rest of his expedition. It is not long before he finds out first hand that the ""hungry dimension"" is indeed very real... Undeterred and intent on learning the truth he ventures alone into the Deathless Boreal.  Today's Prototype: The Kepler Research Institute  Welcome to the Kepler Research Institute. Once the last bastion of hope for the denizens of the Boreal KRI is now in ruins. Once its halls were a place of safety and scientific pursuit. Now they have been ravaged by the forest's curse and the horrors of unchecked science.  You have come here hoping to gather knowledge about the curse of this forest and the monsters living in it. Kepler scientists made many valuable discoveries before they were all mysteriously killed. Now this knowledge is yours for the taking...  and like any true scientist you are willing to face both twisted abominations and opportunistic looters to get your hands on the surviving  data tapes.  About the prototype  This is a prototype of the game and  does not represent the final product . Rather this is an example of how we want the game to work. Some systems are not present but many of them are. In this prototype you will experience:  Brutal combat against 4 types of unique enemies Wielding 4 high impact weapons Meeting 3 unique allies Exploring 5 types of environments Vertical game play with complex but intuitive clambering mechanics (parkour) Puzzles Solving the mystery of what happened at KRI And more...?  We have had a lot of fun working on this and we hope you enjoy what we've made. We are excited to continue building the DENIZEN experience and want to hear your feedback, so when you've played the demo please tell us what you think in the forums below!  If you are interested in following the project you can also  join our mailing list .  We hope you enjoy your stay in the Kepler Labs.   Sincerely,  - The Skunkape Interactive Team",Action||Survival,ambient||Atmospheric||FPS||Mystery||Parkour||Story Rich||Surreal,DENIZEN Prototype (Pre-Alpha),skunkape.itch.io/denizen

Swooshing down a river in a little rowing boat packed with gold and diamonds you try to escape from a big pirate ship that you stole the treasures from. Don’t get caught and avoid the obstacles or your precious gold will go overboard – make it to your hidden cave and save as much treasure as possible!  “The Rapid Treasure Escape” is a communicative co-op experience with unique controls and features six procedurally generated levels in a caribbean setting.  This game was created as a first-semester student project from the 14th December 2017 to the 15th February 2018 at the  Cologne Game Lab .   Controls:   Team members:  Gina Graf – Concept Art, Environment Art, Voice Acting  Rebecca Nöll – Game Design, UI Design, Voice Acting  @Xenophilia  Manuel Ott – Programming, Project Lead  Daniel Turner – Programming  @Turninator95  David Wildemann – 3D Art, Animation, Shader Pope  @FunnyBrutalism  Install instructions Install and Gamepad Instructions  Windows:  After unzipping the file, double click the application icon to start the game.  Gamepad-wise you can use Xbox 360 and One controllers as they are natively supported in Windows, just connect your controller to your PC using a suitable usb cable or adapter and you are good to go.   Other controllers work well with this game too, but might require additional software to run on your Pc.  Mac OS:  After unzipping the file, double click the application icon to start the game. If you want to add the game to your Launchpad simply drag and drop the application Icon onto your applications folder.   Gamepad-wise you can use Playstation 3 and 4 controllers as they are natively supported in Mac Os, just connect your controller to your Mac using a suitable usb cable and you are good to go.   Other controllers work well with this game too, but might require additional software to run on your Mac.  Gameplay Instructions  After starting the game you will be prompt to calibrate the controller. Follow the onscreen instructions.   When you are done adjusting your settings and calibration, return to the main menu. Under the Level-Selection menu you can start the tutorial by selecting the lifebelt.  Known Issues  Although it is a rare appearance, sometimes the game might crash while loading the next level. This is due to the random level generator getting caught in an endless loop. After restarting the game the level will load without problems The controller calibration might get stuck in an unwanted state after the calibration process. Restarting the game fixes this issue.   FAQ  How can I reset my progress?  While in the menu, press F8 and then restart your game. Now you can enjoy  The Rapid Treasure Escape  once more.  I made a mistake while configuring the controls, what should I do?  If you are in the main menu (cave), go to the options menu (treasure map) and select ‘calibration’. If you are in game, press the menu button to activate the pause menu, under ‘calibration’ you can restart the process.  In case the controller is unusable: disconnecting and reconnecting your gamepad or hitting F12 will prompt the configuration window to appear, allowing you to reconfigure the controls.  My antivirus software won’t let me run the game, what should I do?  AV Suites that work with whitelisting move the game to the quarantine folder automatically.

"Ragdoll Runners is a physics-based Track & Field game where you control independently the two legs of an athlete to compete in 8 events of different types: sprint, long jump, triple jump, hurdles.  You control your athlete principally with two keys: one key per leg. Therefore, the gameplay is not based on button mashing like in most other athletics games: it's all about good timing. (A third key allows to lean forward on certain occasions: to finish a sprint, a jump, or to jump over a hurdle.)  Solo : compete against increasingly strong opponents and become a champion in each event. Splitscreen : play against 3 friends on the same computer. Online Confront the world record and your friends' records. Challenge mode: compete against increasingly strong records from the leaderboards and become a concurrent for other players. Daily Contest : experience the stress of competition with a limited number of attempts each day. Do your best in each event to score the most points in the Octathlon.   Your purchase inludes a Steam key for Windows. If you prefer to buy the game on Steam, go to my 	 Steam page .

"NOW WITH MOUSE SUPPORT  Rot is a short psychological horror story about obsession, rejection and self-hatred. It was developed as an experiment, to answer the question: 'can you make dread a place?'. It is inspired by titles such as P.T. and indie developer Kittyhorrorshow's game Anatomy.  It also draws inspiration from Davey Wreden's The Beginner's Guide. The retro, low-res aesthetic of the game is inspired by the work of Finnish indie developer 98DEMAKE, who was kind enough to get in touch during development.   For normal zip:  The WASD keys are used to move, the arrow keys to look around and the enter key to interact when prompted.  For mouse support:  The WASD keys are used to move, the mouse to look around and the mouse button to interact when prompted.  Assets and audio by me. Voice acting by Esmé Varley.  The game makes use of transformative, pixelated renditions of existed copyrighted artworks. I do not claim to own the rights to any of the original images. The pixelated artworks include:  The Lovers , René Magritte, 1928 Dance in the Country ,  Pierre Auguste Renoir, 1883 Il Bacio , Francesco Hayez, 1859 Le Printemps , Pierre-Auguste Cot, 1873 The Kiss , Gustav Klimt, 1908 In Bed: The Kiss , Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, 1892 Warmed By Love , Leonid Afremov (contemporary) Made In Heaven , Jeff Koons, 1989 Love , Robert Indiana, 1965 (artwork by Jesse Draxler, commissioned by Daughters, 2018)  (Please note that the trailer is from a slightly earlier version of the game.

"NON BINARY ""having a gender identity (=feeling of being a particular gender) that is not simply male or female"" from the Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary & Thesaurus  For just a few minutes, step into the shoes of a nonbinary afab person. Go on a date, talk and talk and... well, you'll see what happens.  Based on real life experiences from an actual, breathing and talking nonbinary person. Made in just two days (because real life just keeps on going and there's never enough time for anything) for the Rainbow Game Jam 2019. Fair warning, it doesn't exactly stick to this year's theme - it's based on an idea that I came up with a while ago and just now had a good opportunity to use. It is very much queer, though.

After the jam was over we updated it with music, soundeffects and bugfixes as well as some usability enhancements inspired by the feedback we received at the jam.     NOTES:  Some users report that a Windows SmartScreen alert appears stating that the game isn’t certified.

"This game was developed for the  metagamejam 2018 . Our objective was to create a game that somehow reflects the experience of doing AND playing games.  In this game, you play two games: (1) a QA testing game, where you find and report bugs, and (2) a game inside the game where somebody crashed his car in the forest.  To advance the history, you alternate between both characters (the QA tester and the dude in the forest), trying to go as far as possible. Each bug you find and report as a tester will allow you to know more about the story of the car crash victim.  You can get the project and hack it here :  https://github.com/joansolroo/mgj18-QA  Update log:  10/04/2018: We fixed some visual and control bugs, as people consistently complained about that.

"Super Bash Goats   Super Bash Goats  is a local multiplayer brawler game, where you and up to three friends play as goats in a mountain landscape. Make a bloody mess by bashing your friends into rocks, to be the last goat standing!   The Game  In some beautiful mountains somewhere, a group of goats live peacefully with one another, sharing the luscious grassy hillsides and all the food and comfort it brings… Nah, just kidding.  Super Bash Goats  is the real goaty deal, and there can only be one king of the mountain that gets to graze the green grass!  In Super Bash Goats, you and up to three friends can play together in a fast-paced local multiplayer brawler with one single special mechanic –  bashing .  The bash works in a simple way, charge it by holding down the X button, aim with the left-stick and then bash into your friend, hopefully launching them into rocks and effectively slaughtering them. Each player has 5 lives to spare, and the winner is simply the last goat standing. With a beautiful setting, cute goats… and bloody chunks and gore, Super Bash Goats mixes everything that a party game should have. Grab your friends, some controllers, a PC and start bashing!   Controls  No keyboard support! Gamepads required! (2-4 Player)   The game is  PC only  but each player needs a  controller  to be able to play. We have tested the game with Xbox 360/One and PS4-controllers (  ds4windows   ), but it's possible that the game works with other controllers too.

"In the world of Syx you build big and fight big. You manage things such as diplomacy, dynamic trade and a scheming nobility.   Early access sometime in 2020.  Check out the free prototype here and keep an eye on these channels for more information:  Official Site ,  Twitter ,  YouTube ,  Discord,  Reddit  Songs of Syx is now on:    Help speed along development and get a copy at a discount. The prototype is still free, but will be $25 when the KS is over.   If you like this game, please sign up for the newsletter. We only send emails on very special occasions, like releases or major updates. The submission form is at the   Official Site   Scale:  Population caps and army sizes are 5-digits, while still sticking to the near 1:1 scale of traditional village-simulators.  Nobility : In the colony phase you will be busy managing individual subjects, but as you grow you can elevate your favorite plebs to positions of prominence and have them help you govern and boost different parts of your city and empire. Beware though, as even your most trusted and beloved friends might secretly forge plans to usurp you. Influence : Being a ruler doesn't necessarily mean absolute power. You must grow and maintain your influence over time by accommodating your plebs and your nobility and be forced to make choices that lies in their interest rather than your own. If you overstep you can expect riots, betrayals, invasions and emigration. Dynamic Culture:  Races and factions will start with a certain mindset and culture, but there is nothing stopping and influential king from molding an unique identity for their people. You will be able to dictate to your own laws and policies, to sophisticate or plunge your civilization in savagery.  Trade:  Anyone can set up a self-sustaining shithole anywhere. But if you want a city and later, an empire, you need to get into the game of trading where goods are priced by supply and demand and wars and fierce diplomacy is waged for the control of goods and trade-routes.  Maintenance:   Every construction you build and every technology you research will require maintenance in the form of labor and resources. Failing to deliver that might cause ripples that can quickly collapse a once mighty civilization.   Modding:  The game itself is built like a mod of simple text-files, sprite sheets and a few scripts. It will be easy and encouraged to make your own races, stories and worlds. Hordes, Immigration, Slaves:  The global climate might plunge into a mini ice-age, or suffer from a severe drought which can set in motion vast migrations and hoards, looking for their next meal, or fertile lands to settle on. Might be yours. Break the backs of slaves as they toil day and night plowing your fields and cleaning your latrines. They might not be happy about it though. Open your gates to all the kinds of strange races of Syx and see your economy and culture blossom from the diversity, or hate and racism tear your city apart. Awesome Soundtrack:  By  this goddess  , who plays like 50000 instrument Story:  Lastly, there will be a story mode with a set, but flexible timeline where you will play as heroes defeating the ultimate evil.

"From Next Door is a short mystery-horror game developed for the 2016 Pixel Horror Jam, featuring 100% original graphics, story-driven gameplay, exploration and decision making. It draws inspiration from the works of Junji Ito and games like Silent Hill, with the story focused on the eerie and the bizarre.  Story  Namie has just moved into a new house, one that was rented for a too-good-to-be-true price. It seemed like a good idea at first - nice house, low price, fully furnished, quiet neighborhood… but when she comes across a locked room on the second floor, she starts to realize there's more to the house than what she was told. Why is that room locked? Why did the previous tenant leave the house so suddenly, leaving his things behind? And what's the deal with the windowless house next door?  Gameplay  The game is largely centered around the story itself, with the player exploring the environment to discover clues and to progress forward. Exploration is the key to uncovering the game's mysteries - and although the game follows a linear story line, the choices you make will affect how you discover information and, perhaps, even affect the outcome of things.

"Somewhere between sanity and madness lies a realm torn between the two. Illusions become reality, and reality becomes nothing more than a vision. 	HUMAN is a short psychological horror game which examines inherent, earthly, and otherworldly evils, and the forces which drive them. As you make your way through an Alaskan auroral research facility in search of employees it quickly becomes very clear that something has become alerted to your presence. Suspiciously, once it knows you're there, you're more than welcome to be there. Drawing you in, you soon begin to question all you see and hear. 	HUMAN is highly metaphorical, yet accessible. All is explained in its simplest essence, but for those willing to look beyond the surface, there lies layer upon layer of symbolism, and clues regarding the nature of reality, which add depth to the meaning behind HUMAN. 	HUMAN is primarily story and experience driven, however environmental puzzles and problem solving are interlaced within. 	CONTROLS: 	W, A, S, D - Movement 	Right Mouse Button - Zoom In/Out (Useful for reading tablet screens and papers)	  	F - Flashlight 	E - Interact 	Shift - Run 	I am a one-man development team.

"Ghost Hospital is a game about anxiety, depression, despair, mental rock bottoms, and, of course, ghosts. You play as Robin, a twelve-year-old girl who has an anxiety disorder and is very much alive in this hospital meant for beings that are not alive. Frankly, her anxiety was already bad enough  before  she landed in a hospital full of dead people, the still-shambling shells of ancient ghosts who try to take her down for a sweet taste of life, and the hospital directors hellbent on keeping her contained, and more importantly, away from the reason she's REALLY there.  Thankfully, you have your new friends Jay and Sarcastic Ghost- Jay is a ghost about your age, and still a very new arrival to the hospital, and Sarcastic Ghost…well, he's an amorphous blob of a ghost, who talks a lot despite not having a mouth.  _____  Review from Waypoint   Reccomendation from Rock Paper Shotgun  Review from Nitro Rad  _____  Lead Game, art, and story director: Lev Lefton  Assistant Developers: Tredlocity, C / Ghoultreats  Assistant writer: Rosemary Arnold  Assistant concept artist: Maggie K.

"Fling to the Finish Alpha Demo    In Fling to the Finish,  teams of two  players race through colorful, chaotic obstacle courses while tethered by a  stretchy elastic rope .   When you and your friends first pick up the game your rope will get  tangled  in practically everything you pass. But as you quickly improve your communication skills you'll learn that the rope is your  biggest asset .   Experienced players can use the rope to  swing  around perilous obstacles, and  fling  their partner up ledges before they fall to their doom. When partners master using their rope, they're capable of acrobatic feats unachievable in any other platformer!  Teams can show off their skills by competing in online or local races with a bunch of other players!  Because you're literally attached to your partner, Fling to the Finish is a truly cooperative experience. If you want, you can even play through Fling to the Finish by sharing a controller with your partner.   This control scheme is great for local co-op, and adds an extra dimension to the game. While you push and pull each other in game, try not to do the same in real life!      Local Multiplayer (1-4 players)  Locally, two teams can race against each other on any track.   Online Multiplayer (1-16 players)  Local players can invite online friends to compete in private races with up to 4 teams.   A single player, local team, or online team can play online against up to 7 other teams in random public multiplayer races.    Local/ Online Co-Op Campaign (1-2 players)  Two players can play by themselves through our challenging campaign mode. Players connecting over the internet can also play through this mode with an online friend.  Single Player Campaign (1 player)  If you're a fan of challenging platforming games, this mode has you covered.  Single players can experience our challenging solo campaign, along with other challenge modes that modify the rope and make getting through levels more difficult   Every course in Fling to the Finish has a unique theme and style. Race through floating parks, giant casinos, and even worm filled asteroid fields to reach the finish line! We designed every obstacle to force you to use the rope in a new way, so every second is filled with new surprises and memorable moments. The race track even evolves to challenge you as you play, so every race is a nail biter. You'll never know what weird obstacle you'll find next.       Opponents  battle back  with  hails of plungers, sinking weights, and evil lasers  if they fall behind. Our items keep the races interesting, and help  even the score  if one player has more experience than another.            Found a bug?

"Zissi (the player) has traveled from far away to visit her grandmother which coincidentally is about to celebrate her birthday. Of course, Zissi forgot it was soon going to be her grandma's birthday so she didn't get her a present and must now search the island for pearls to make her a pearl necklace as soon as possible before it's too late... after all, it might be  her last birthday ever.   Features!  A pretty-big open world. Go almost anywhere at the very start of the game.  Find items to help you on your quest for the pearls.  Collect coins, gold bars and rubies to buy items.  Dynamic day-night cycle.  Talk to the inhabitants of the island to get tips or just find out what their favorite thing in the whole world is.    Original art made by me. It's good enough, I think.  Multiple endings depending on how many pearls you collect (you need at least 20) and/or how long it takes you.  Sequence breaking? There are barely any sequences! Find out where a pearl is and go get it. Sometimes you need an item to get it but you can also get items in a different order every time you play.  Controller and Keyboard+Mouse support (Xbox Controller recommended).  No bosses. Sorry but boss fights didn't fit the carefree atmosphere of the game. Also, they're hard to do and I rather have no boss fights than have crappy boss fights.   The game is pretty relaxed and chill. If you're looking for a challenge then this game might not be for you, unless you like speedrunning. There's backtracking. I like backtracking but do you? There is a way to turn on some teleporters that make moving around the island so much easier but you need to buy an item first and then bring it to a friend on the other side of the island.

Will you offer the best teachers and facilities or cheap out and build giant classrooms with a 1:100 teacher to student ratio? It's all up to you!  Student motivation is driven by various needs, including hygiene, hunger, and discipline, and they'll become even more complex as time goes on, eventually competing in school competitions like spelling bees and even falling in love.

Plot out their routes yourself in order to ensure maximum efficiency. From potted plants to statues and fountains, we have everything to make your school the envy of all! And we'll keep adding decorative objects so that you can have a completely unique school. Customize your school seal and motto to make a school that is uniquely yours!

"Love March ラブ・マーチ Made for GBJam 5. Love March  is a sort-of puzzle game with elements inspired by  Pikmin . You are on a mission to confess your love to someone, but you've got to trek all the way across the city to get there. Naturally, when you march with such a spring in your step, people are inclined to support you. Use band formations to prevent your band members from running into hazards, and aim for the highest score in each level. I'd like to come back to this some day and work it into something more complete, but for now there are three levels and a simple ending. The tutorials should be enough to get you going, the rest is up to you to figure out. I may or may not have made levels 2 & 3 too hard. Arrow keys to control, Z and X for actions. Made in GameMaker. Art in GraphicsGale and music and sound effects made in  Deflemask  (with the exception of one sound effect made in Famitracker). Protip: in case you missed it, you can use the blockade formation to protect from bicycle riders.",Action||Puzzle||Strategy,2D||8-Bit||Game Boy||GBJam||pikmin,Love March,squiddingme.itch.io/love-march

Somehow, you thought moving to a new city would help you meet people you actually like. That you'd find fun activities to do and better opportunities all around.

"Endless ATC is an easy to play simulation game, where you are an air traffic controller at the approach radar of a busy airport. The goal is to guide the planes safely to the runways to get a high score. If you make no errors, the number of planes you have to control gets larger and larger. How many flights at a time can you handle?  	The game shows you a tracon radar screen with locations of planes and runways. Arrivals and departures will appear randomly. The interface is simple, but the simulation is on scale and the planes behave realistically. So: easy controls, hardcore simulation. If you're unfamiliar with aviation, please read the instructions first.  		 Instructions   		• Select a plane, give it a descend instruction (to about 2000 feet), guide it to the blue line at a large distance from the runway (there are arrows to help you), and give it clearance for an ILS (Instrument Landing System) approach, which means it will follow the line to the runway like in real life. It's also handy to check out the screenshots and the video.  • In order to land, a plane must comply to three conditions:  	 the ILS mode of the plane is activated,  	 the plane is descended low enough to intercept the glideslope; the blue circles mark the heights of 2000, 3000 and 4000 feet,  	 the plane must intercept the ILS at a heading of 50 degrees or less with respect to the runway (in reality they use 30 degrees).  		• If you do this correctly you will gain skill points. You can also lose skill points when planes:  	 fly too close to eachother (overlapping circles and altitude difference <1000 feet),  	 leave the airspace (outer grey circle), also if they are departures but leave the airspace or below FL90,  	 missed approaches / go arounds, area violations / flying through weather.   		• The amount of planes that you have to control is about the same as the amount of skill points you have: the higher the skill value, the more planes you have to deal with. You can also achieve 'goals' by landing a certain amount of planes without mistakes.  	• Challenge yourself even more by enabling crosswinds and thunderstorms!   		• Some planes have an additional tag, for example 'RD'; only these planes need to land on a secondary airport.  • The full version now includes lots of variation with 9 airports:  Amsterdam  Schiphol,  London  Heathrow,  Frankfurt ,  Atlanta  Hartsfield–Jackson,  Paris  Charles de Gaulle,  New York  JFK,  Tokyo  Haneda,  Toronto  Pearson and  Sydney .  		• In the menu there are options including speed multiplier, radar update rate, and a custom traffic mode for a more relaxed gameplay: set precisely the amount of traffic you like.  	 Updated:   23 March 2020 (v4.1.1):  Airport elevation for secondary airports Fast forward 20x speed by pressing and holding the menu button (or press F11 key) Planes already in a turn won't leave and re-enter the airspace Several minor adjustments   		For more detailed instructions, changelogs and questions, see:  startgrid.blogspot.com   		 Features   	 endless amount of planes, multiple runways,  	 give radar vectors like a real air traffic controller, 	 realistic mechanics and pilot behavior, but easy to play, 	 amount of traffic adapts to your skill level,  	 automatically saving game; resume where you left off, choose from 9 different airports (EHAM, EGLL, EDDF, KATL, LFPG, KJFK, RJTT, CYYZ, YSSY) 	 text-to-speech output",Simulation,air-traffic-control||approach||atc-sim||atlanta||frankfurt||heathrow||radar||schiphol||tokyo||tracon,Endless ATC,startgrid.itch.io/endlessatc

"Come away, O human child! To the waters and the wild with a faery, hand in hand, for the world’s more full of weeping than you can understand.  ~ W.B. Yeats   Description    Changeling is a non-stat raising, full-length visual novel about love, reconciliation, and trying to survive in a dangerous supernatural world. Play through about 30-40 hours of content and over 40 unique endings while trying to survive the perils of a newly discovered paranormal community. Romance one of 6 love interests as you uncover information about the supernatural and the secrets from your own past - all while you try to patch up your relationship with your twin brother who grows more and more suspicious of you with each passing day.    Story   The human world accepted as reality is only a thin veneer under which lies a world of supernatural creatures, entities, and people. They live beside humans hiding their nature or walking among them unseen. And most people go about their lives entirely unaware of the dangers around them. Mysterious situations are written off as fake, or they're glossed over with some sort of mundane explanation.    The same was true for Nora, a normal girl struggling with the usual litany of everyday problems - including her crumbling relationship with an angry, resentful twin brother with whom she's nearly given up on reconciling.    But her family's return to the town in which she'd grown up set in motion a chain of events that would shatter every illusion she had about a world she thought she knew. Her eyes newly opened to the truth around her, Nora begins a journey to uncover the secrets of her own mysterious past and the reason for her brother's bitter hatred toward her. Alongside her best friend, and a group of unusual guys she met after her return, Nora begins to chip away at the lies shrouding her life. Lies that have been haunting her since childhood.   But in a world where Vampires, Werewolves, and Faeries are real, learning the truth may come at a high cost.     Features (totals below are based on the full game)  685,000 words (around 100-115k per route, not including the common route)   25-35 hours of playable content (4-6 hours per route)*   6 love interests   Over 40 unique endings   30+ unique CGs   30+ unique backgrounds   30+ characters and sprites   Developed side characters     *calculated at a reading speed of 300 wpm   Install instructions Builds have been tested with a small group but please report glitches or problems you encounter here, tumblr or twitter!

"That thou mayst be a queen, and check the world! - William Shakespeare  Description     Gilded Shadows will be a full-length visual novel that explores a whimsical, yet dangerous world which blends the solarpunk and cyberpunk aesthetics into a unique adventure. The player can explore different factions and story lines based on their choices in the common route.  The final game is planned to contain 25-30 hours of content where your personality traits lock or unlock various interactions and responses to situations. As you follow the MC on her journey, pursue one of six love interests in a stand-alone story unique to that route.   Story  Altair is a planet with a complex history.   Centuries ago, when humans arrived, they found it abandoned. The only remnants of its previous society were massive bio-domes dotted on the surface and designed as protection from the hostile climate.  With one side of the world bathed in eternal day and the other cloaked in frigid night, the bio-domes are oases where people live sheltered from the scorching winds and storms. But whether in the bright, clean cities of the day side of the planet, or the poor and crime-ridden cities of the night side, life is never simple nor peace easy to come by.  When a fateful encounter exposes Morgan Leone, a young woman who has long hid her ESP, as a queen ranked Esper, she finds herself on the run from multiple factions eager to attain her abilities. Endgame, the planetary defence organisation; Crimson, a notorious crime syndicate from Delphine; and even the shadowy group only known as ""the Host"" - each group sends operatives to retrieve her.   Now, with several paths open to her, she must choose her allies carefully. Between light and shadow lies grey twilight where the lines between good and evil are blurred. And in a world where the only constants are the endless day and night that divide the planet, Morgan learns those who can't adapt...also can't survive.

"Orcish Inn is a farming, survival and tavern simulation game in which you raise crops, brew beer and build a tavern for your orcish guests!  Wishlist Orcish Inn on Steam to get notified about its release!   The project is currently put on hold. 	    	 IMPORTANT:   Adding the Orcish Inn Pre-Alpha to your itch.io library  won't  give you access to the final release version of Orcish Inn. I may stop publishing updates here on itch.io (and everywhere else) at some point during development.  On release, I may add the release version of Orcish Inn as a  paid  tier or not at all. 	   Why? On the one hand, I want to develop the game in public and distribute the in-development version for free, so I can get feedback from as many people as possible, but on the other hand, I don't want to make the final version free (as I have to eat, too). Therefore, I'm offering the free pre-alpha via my website, as a demo on Steam and also here on itch.io. :)   Like said above, development is currently put on hold.    	 Orcish inn is a tavern simulation game in which you take the role of an innkeeper starting out in unsettled lands. You gather resources, farm all sorts of crops like hops and oat, brew your own beers, construct a tavern piece by piece and welcome various orcish clans to your very own place. The game interweaves aspects of management and simulation with those of survival and exploration.  	 FARMING  Plant and harvest various types of crops like hops, oat, sugar-beets, tomatoes and many more, which are then sold, eaten or used as beer flavor. 	 BREWING  Brew your own types of beer and influence your guests by defining the beers' taste, tint brightness, full body, bitterness, alcoholic strength and flavor. 	 PRODUCING  Gather and process resources, like chopping trees for logs and process them into lumber planks and decorative planks spent in building and crafting. 	 CONSTRUCTING  Construct buildings like brewing facilities, taverns or dorm rooms by putting down walls and floors and decorate the created rooms with crafted furniture. 	 SERVING  Serve the visiting orcish clans by fulfilling their wishes, fine-tune prices or the beer's taste or risk getting battered in a huge pub brawl. 	 AND MORE  Raise and breed animals like pigeons, which swirl around and bring back useful items, or wrest valuable treasures from the ocean with your fishing rod.    	The game is in development since 2014 and the unfinished pre-alpha is currently available for free.

Changes in V1.1 :  4 new tracks.   Some reordering of the tracks and a few amendments to a couple of older tracks.   Ramps which can be jumped - if not properly aligned or going too slow the game will help you out a little.   Gates which can be driven though for a shortcut.    The AI now adjusts to your skill and properly races with different race lines.   The AI will start harder and adjust more if you select the harder starting tracks. Slight modification to the shadow routines so some tracks now have 18 colours.  Changed in V1.2:   4 new tracks giving a total of 20. Flipped versions (reflected on x axis) of normal / reverse track direction can now be selected in the Options menu.  See NORMAL X and REVERSE X.   This gives a total of 80 tracks for more variety. Minor reordering of some tracks, you now start on tracks 1,3,5, .. 15 rather than 1,2,3, .. 8.  This allows you to race the new tracks without winning 9 races first. Movement can be changed to Per Pixel in the Options menu.  This is on by default and makes movement much smoother in higher resolutions.   Scores now flash if you've reached the leaderboard.

"A game jam dedicated to gardening, puzzles, and the kindest talking tulip I know - Mr. Tulip Head. Grab a cup of coffee, sit down, and enjoy the harmonies of landscaping as you help Mr. Tulip Head design garden plots and solve puzzles focused on gradually working towards building a better garden. Gardening is not always as easy as it looks, it requires patience, perseverance, and a steady mind. But as Mr. Tulip Head always says ""Zet hem op"" - you can do this.    Playing with a mouse over trackpad is recommended. All of the instructions are covered during the game, but in case Mr. Tulip Head is on coffee break and you need a refresher.  Left Click  - Place selected tile. Right Click  - Pick up tile: tiles that can not be picked up are slightly lower and grayed out.                          Pathway:  Must connect to each other. Must make a clear path from gate A to gate B without breaking. Tulip:  The most charming plant, tulips score 1 charm for each  adjacent  path tile. Additional bulbs act as a multiplier for a tulip's charm score. Water:  Must be placed near an already existing water tile. Water helps tulips grow: one bulb for each surrounding water tile. Tulips can grow up to three bulbs on a single tile. Statues:  Not as narcissistic as they look. Cannot be placed near another statue and must be spread out.    This is my third game for my jam-a-month project. It was meant to be a week long jam (ended up being 10 days) that at times felt more like a weak, long jam. This game is inspired by working with my father building and improving his garden. It is a lot of fun making small gradual improvements to something you care about and eventually looking back and seeing the big change at the end. I hope that translated into the design and you can enjoy that feeling with me.  As always the project is developed in Unity and all graphics and code  are made from scratch. Music is by John Leonard French - purchased under the ""Ultimate Game Music Collection"" from the Unity Asset Store. If you enjoy the game please reach out in the comments below. Additional Thanks to  Jonathon Brown  for his advisory role on improving and publishing this project to other popular web-portals. Since its initial development Mr. Tulip Head has been launched on ArmorGames, Kongregate, Newgrounds, CoolMathGames and CrazyGames: placing second-runner up in Kongregate's November 2018 contest and 2nd place in Crazy Games' 2018 developer contest.",Puzzle,Casual||Cute||Funny||Gardening||Isometric||minigames||Minimalist||Tilemap based tools||Unity,Mr. Tulip Head,stilaan.itch.io/mr-tulip-head

"Critical Alpha is an arcade combat flight-sim like I used to play in the early 90s.  The best thing about those early flight sims was the up-close dog-fighting with guns, so I've tried to capture that feeling here.    There is no auto-aim, there are no missiles, just pure dog-fighting skill over procedurally generated landscapes, with procedurally generated missions.  Set across three different time-periods, you'll fight bad guys using biplanes, jet fighters, and futuristic spacecraft, each with a very different feel.    Controls are keyboard or joypad (tested using the PS4 dualshock 4 pad).  I recommend using a joypad for the most enjoyable experience but the keyboard works just fine. (note: there are no mouse controls and this is a deliberate design decision, so please bear that in mind)  Critical Alpha was a collaborative project, developed in the  Gamkedo club .  Check it out for loads more free games developed by folks collaborating from all over the world.

Or to enjoy yourself if you're after a stress-free experience.  The Lighthouse Keeper has invited you to stay but when you arrive on their island you find they have abandoned their post and have left a series of clues leading to their hidden treasure.

You're in a race against dwindling resources, and systems break down rapidly. Your crew are your only hope.  There's a catch: the crew members are independent beings. You can't control them.

"Orphan Age is a  life-sim game  where you  look after a band of orphans  in a  cyberpunk warzone .    Set against the backdrop of an unforgiving,  neon-lit dystopian warzone , your only battle is the fight for survival, scraping out a living in the face of extreme danger. You will  guide a band of orphans , each with their own skills, emotions, strengths, weaknesses and fears, through a  dangerous and ever-changing city  in a bitter struggle for survival.  Constantly  balancing risk and reward , you must make the big decisions to  ensure the group stays alive .  Build  up your base,  scavenge ,  craft  and  explore  the city for new recruits, whilst ensuring there are enough supplies to  keep going , even when it seems  all hope might be lost .    Orphan Age plays as a single player campaign with a lot of replayability inspired by the 4X genre. But there’s a twist!  4X stands for  Exploration ,  Exploitation ,  Expansion  and  Extermination . In Orphan Age, we replace Extermination with  Empathy , bending the 4X genre into a 4E.  The city of Orphan Age is ever-changing and procedural. You won't find the same building twice. There are  high risks and high rewards  when you  explore . You can find  rare resources ,  Orphans to recruit , but you can also get wounded or worse... Exploration is similar to the expeditions of Fallout Shelter: procedural text adventures. They offer more complexity though, because you have to make decisive choices while you're out of the orphanage. Hundreds of resources  are left to be scavenged in the Orphanage or in the city. They are classified in  6 categories  that allow you to eat, drink, take care of wounds and to craft the items and resources you need to build your Orphanage.  The Orphanage is the place your Orphans call home. The  environment  surrounding the Orphans greatly affects their moods. Try to keep the rooms lit, warm, furnished and clean for the happiness of all!  There are  38 different items of furniture to build  (beds, playgrounds, science mats, campfire, heaters...) and each one can be  upgraded .  Research  allows you to discover better furniture and improve living conditions for the orphans. Orphan Age is a  deep micro-simulation  making each Orphan unique in personality and in gameplay. The Orphans have  different ages, set of skills, backgrounds and personality traits . Depending on who they are and how well they are, the Orphans will take  different paths anytime there is an issue to be discussed.

"a Museum of Dubious Splendors, is a storybook from the world of Somewhere.  It is an adaptation of a series of essays written by Mir UmarHassan, a Gujarati poet whose works have proven notoriously difficult to translate because of the mellifluous use of Urdu and Hindi in his compositions.  We first encountered the writings of Mir UmarHassan in the archive room of the  Sanghralaya  at Matsyapur. Copies of his essays were bound together in ledgers and stored there, evidently unused and unread.   Of all his writings that we have assiduously collected over the past decade, it is his chronicle of Ruhan Nissa Parkes that fascinates us the most.   These stories entitled ""in Dubious Splendor"", were written (in Gujarati) in nineteen sixty two for the Malwa Chronicle,  but were mangled and edited without the author's permission prior to their publication in serialized form. The collection of stories, became momentarily infamous as the subject of the first court case to arbitrate authorial ownership in Independent India.  Even today, despite countless restorative efforts by scholars, it cannot be said with with any certainty that the text that we used for this adaptation was the original as written by UmarHassan.   .......................................................................................................  In short: you get to read some nice short stories and look at lovely little rooms. Oleomingus are making some of the prettiest dang video games around.  - Rock Paper Shotgun.

"""In my country, history itself is edible. Time masticated into tales, people digested into stories.  Places leak mineral flavor.  Buildings are grated and ground. Domes flattened into rotis, Blood boiled into dal.  The very earth on which we once grew, is reabsorbed into the metabolism of a nation that has decided to consume itself, like an ouroboros.  A glorious violent meal. A spectacular event.  A prelude to excreting people who have been leached of all flavor and all difference. The ideal members of a new state. Excrement of the old.""  - Mir UmarHassan 1960 (Translated 1983).  In 1961 when the state of Bombay split like an egg on the jagged edge of the Western Ghats and formed the territories of Gujarat and Maharashtra, the town of Matsyapura was abandoned by government decree - to make it easier to draw a clean border between the new states.   Mir UmarHassan, the fabled Gujarati poet, lamented this willful and violent erasure of an ancient town and in a delightful satirical poem, where he wrote about the vapid consumption of a place and the excretion of a people devoid of the flavors of their individual and munificent past.  With recent cause to recollect the horror of the demolition of Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, and in solidarity with the protests against the draconian actions of our government - we are revisiting UmarHassan's original poem.  The indifferent wonder of an edible place, is our attempt to ponder the violence of erasure and the profound grief of having to survive on the margins of history.    Created with support from Phoenix, Leicester which is supported by Arts Council England. And a site-specific variant of the game was displayed at Phoenix, Leicester and at the Video Game Art Gallery in Chicago.  . . . . . . . . .  In The Indifferent Wonder Of An Edible Place, Studio Oleomingus manage to ask poignant questions about what it means to be a part of erasing history, and what can be done – if anything – to intervene. It is particularly heart-wrenching.  - Rock Paper Shotgun   . . . . . . . . .",,Altgame||artgame||Experimental||Exploration||First-Person||Short||Story Rich||Surreal||Unity||Walking simulator,The Indifferent Wonder of an Edible Place,studio-oleomingus.itch.io/the-indifferent-wonder-of-an-edible-place

The Second Demo (2019) Features:  Completely brand new scenes for each love interest + CGs New UI, new music, autoplay function 7 CGs  Bonus art!  You do not need to play the first demo to understand this one.  Made in preparation for PAX West 2019, the second demo is intended to be a much shorter play through than the first demo, and showcases scattered snippets of events beyond the first demo. Go on a museum sorta-date, bake cookies, woo a cat, and offer to be a blood bag because at least that way you won't be alone.   Make sure to unzip the .zip files and extract them before trying to run the game! For Mac, if you're having trouble running it, try dragging the executable directly into Terminal.) While there is an Android version provided by request, it's not indicative of a final product and may have glitches and heavy memory cost, and we recommend a computer version to play instead. If you have any tech problems or feedback, comment below or email us at contact@studiochiffon.com ♡  The First Demo Features:  60k+ words total 6 ""routes"" + 4 unique endings Rated 17+ for mature language and topics (see end of info for spoilers) 1 CG (it's Madison's, but you can play any route)  Halloween is the perfect time to have fun, dress up, and not notice anything odd about the fangs in a hot stranger's mouth. And honestly?  Diana is here for all of that. Unsatisfied with her social, romantic,  and  academic life, she figures she can at least solve the first two at the party she's been invited to.  Instead, she ends up breaking her heels, making bad puns, taking cute photos, playing matchmaker, and fighting for attention from the obligatory party cat throughout the night before everything goes horribly, horribly wrong. Because, well. Something has to give besides the heels.  Softly, With Teeth  as a whole is a coming-of-age romance visual novel that combines vampires with Faustian lore and an urban fantasy aesthetic, and explores the aftermath of someone's life once even the most significant of changes settle into routine. People always desire more than what they have, after all, but what lengths will they go to to achieve it?  For all demos, all assets including art, music, and choreography may (and have) change at a later time.  A list of known bugs is here.  SPOILER WARNING  This game is about vampires. Demo includes drinking, innuendo, blood and violence (vampire bite), discussion of non-consent relating to vampire bite, occasional situations where protagonist is distinctly and rightfully uncomfortable, but also a consensual bite too.

"When Finn was eighteen, he knew exactly where he was heading in life. He was slated to graduate high school as valedictorian, attend an Ivy League school to study law on a three-fourths scholarship, walk away with a Masters, and become a politician that represented Ohio in the US Senate. It didn't quite line up with his (admittedly far-fetched) dreams of being a star pianist in the New York Philharmonic, but it was what his  father  dreamed for him.  It's difficult to do pursue either of those dreams when your father casts you out onto the street for kissing another boy, though; it didn't take long for both of their dreams to crumble away.  Now, at twenty-four, Finn has no vision of his future. All Finn has time to do is work, take care of his daughter, work more, and leave work to go to more work. And, when it isn't enough to keep a roof over Ava's head and food in her belly, he works even further into the night with three glasses of Cabernet in his system and the scent of shame clinging to the sheets.  He can't remember the last time he slept a full eight hours, or even ate a proper meal. He can no longer recall when he last made it through an entire day without a panic attack. In the back of his mind he knows that this is no way to live, but he refuses to complain or torment himself with ideas of what could have been. As far as he's concerned, just the fact that he and Ava are finally away from  him  is finally something to thank his stars for.  Until Koloa makes it his mission to teach Finn what it means to finally  live .  The Secrets We Keep is Studio Senpai's first visual novel, and is currently still in progress with 200k words and several story choices to make.

"ABOUT THE GAME:  In this visual novel, Ruby Rose is the long-lost princess of the Kingdom of Vale, and heir to the titular Summer Rose Court. She is discovered and pulled from her peaceful life in the desert, back to the kingdom’s capital of Beacon, where she must prepare for a war against the creatures of Grimm.  Along the way she must recruit new allies, including Knight Commander Ser Weiss Schnee, mysterious faunus rebel Blake Belladonna, dragon tamer Yang Xiao Long, young and inexperienced soldier Jaune Arc, the warrior priestess Pyrrha Nikos, the acolyte Lie Ren, and the fearless sailor Nora Valkyrie.  There are multiple romance options. Playing as Ruby, you can romance Weiss, Blake, Yang, or anyone in team JNPR.  There are five endings to the game, depending on your choices.  Summer Rose Court is a fan made game, not endorsed by Rooster Teeth at all, and completely divorced from the show. It is completely free to download and play. All we ask in return is you consider leaving a kind comment, a review, or share the game with your friends.   Additionally, if you have never watched or even heard of RWBY, you should be able to play and enjoy this game with pretty much 0 context. You just probably won't get some of the inside jokes.  The game is available for Windows, Linux, and Mac.  We also have a soundcloud  https://soundcloud.com/summer-rose-court  If you have any issues or run into any bugs, please leave us a comment here or send an email with a screenshot / traceback text to srcdevteam@gmail.com  ABOUT US  During the hiatus between Volumes 1 & 2, a group of about thirty fans got together and said, ""Wouldn't it be neat to make a visual novel? And make it really gay? With like lots of different endings and branching paths and stuff? I mean how hard could it be?""  Four years later, we realized, ""Pretty f***ing hard, actually.""   We'd like to extend our greatest thanks to tumblr user  Dori  for creating the initial art and concept for Summer Rose Court. Without them kickstarting the project, this would have never launched. Dori is the artist who drew the Ruby & Weiss sprites, AKA one of the pieces of art you'll see for the majority of the game. We're deeply grateful to them for being the one to start this.  We grew a lot in this period of time, and this project is a labor of love. No money exchanged hands during the development of this game— only dedication, and what spare time we could offer.  Thank you, all of you, for your patience over the last four years.   We kept moving forward. Thank you, Monty.",Visual Novel,Fangame||Fantasy||Female Protagonist||LGBT||rwby||Yuri,Summer Rose Court,summer-rose-studios.itch.io/src
"This is the second installment in the After the Shift universe.   While I would class it as an RTS just because of the style of gameplay, I wouldn't call it a strictly 'strategy' game because the only real strategy is about how quickly you can build.

"Asher is a short visual story about a librarian — all right, librarian’s assistant — named Tetrine Reish who lives in the city-state of Asher. Things are going swimmingly (except for perhaps her brother’s debt/bootlegging problem and an ominous dream or two,) until a woman comes along asking for a book. Not a library book — that would be too easy — but a book that doesn’t belong in Tetrine’s library. The book turns out to be written in a magical script called Nell marks that only a few people can see, and Tetrine is one of them.  However, all her life she’s been told in no uncertain terms that letting on that she can see the marks is a Bad Idea. Which is unfortunate, because several people, two of whom have suspicious intentions, find out. A kidnapping and an attempted murder (or two) ensues, and Tetrine’s life will never quite be the same again.",Interactive Fiction||Visual Novel,1920s||Gothic||Twine||Vampire,Asher,sunlabyrinth.itch.io/asher

"Foreveracers is a bouncy wobbly arcade online multiplayer driving game. Jump in to the action with no fuss. Race, roam, roll, crash, and challenge as you drive around the game world day and night. Cut corners, find shortcuts and avoid other players while trying to set the best lap times or win the challenges.    Each car in the game has a distinct feel and unique characteristics, and the physics model means that balance is as much part of challenge (and fun) as the optimal racing line. And each car has their own 'optimal racing line', since as long as you hit the checkpoints in order, you're free to find your own route around the circuit!  	You can challenge (and be challenged by) other players in the game to races or to special challenge modes. Everyone that accepts the challenge will join that game mode, and anyone that doesn't can just carry on driving as they were, maybe to join or issue the next challenge. When not in a challenge, just drive through a start line to begin a lap, drive somewhere else to find another circuit whenever you want, or maybe explore to see if you can find an unlock for the hidden circuits. Or if you just want to quickly change car or jump to a different circuit, you can do so too.  Features  All one world - You're free to drive between the different circuits, and explore the world, without any reloading. Day/Night cycle - The racing in Foreveracers never ends, so keep driving night and day. Over 12 circuits - 4 initial circuits, 4 hidden circuits to find, and additional mirrored variants to then unlock. Race challenge - Issue a race challenge to other players, those that accept will line up and race to the finish line. Special Challenge Modes - If you want a break from the racing, then challenge players to a Scavenge Hunt or Rust-Bucket Survival challenge 6 Main Vehicles - from the slow and steady Starter Car, through to the 'too fast' Sports Car, and the frankly ridiculous Clown Car. Leaderboards - See how your lap times compare to others (steam version only) Live world rank - Your current world rank is displayed for whichever circuit you currently have active, try to improve your best time and move up to #1! (steam version only) Ghosts - If you're just lapping alone then the 'ghost' of your best lap will start when you do.  Note For Solo Players  We believe there is fun to be had with this game even if playing alone - start an online game and while waiting for others to join, you can drive, explore, time trial, try to improve your world ranking and unlock the extra circuits. However, we do want to make it clear that there is no single player 'story' or challenge structure, there are no AI racers in the game, so if you're only looking for a game to play alone/offline, then this may not be for you.  Steam Purchase Only The game is not currently available to buy through itch. Due to the way their pricing works, and the requirement for us not to sell less than the steam price (as we would want to include a steam key as the game utilises steam for leaderboards etc.) it's not practical for us to offer it for sale here at this time. If you are interested in the full game, please check out the game on steam.

Were your memory loss to be discovered it would be at great strain to your family. Without getting caught, uncover the mystery of your amnesia while navigating between politics and romance. Evade political, social, and sometimes physical dangers to regain what you’ve lost or choose to move beyond your forgotten history. Aid in the exploration of an ancient archaeological site while putting Avalon’s political stability at risk or help maintain the current status quo. While maybe along the way finding life-long friends or unexpected romance…  Current and Planned Features: •	Over 100,000 words of content and over 180 choices at current demo script.  (Current script beyond demo at 150,000 words of content and 260 choices) •	Many genres and story lines to explore. •	Rated: PG-13 •	Numerous Endings (Eventually there are at least 23 endings currently planned - 7 good romance endings, 7 bad romance endings, 9 friendship endings) •	7 Romanceable Male NPCs (Six Open Romances, One Secret Romance) •	Friendship routes possible for male NPCs • 2 BFF (Best Friend Forever) Female NPCs  •	MC Sprite •	Rivalries between Romanced Male NPCs.  - Currently 25 Achievements in demo (37 at current script) Needs for Game Development:  (Currently Recognized Needs) •	Probably more sound effects.  •	CG Artist (Would like at least 7 CG’s for the romanced characters and others as affordability allows) Personal Description of Fate Maker Games: I’m Suru (though I also often go by Aura and Ash in online forums), the founder of Fate Maker Games. I love crafting stories and worlds for people to learn about and explore and thought an interesting way in which to do so was through the virtual novel medium. This is Fate Maker Games first project, with many storyboards and notes for future games connected to this world.  Hopes for Production: We hope to continue to work on the game as time allows moving forward (this is a secondary job for us and is paid for by primary professions that require time first).  However, we want to make sure going forward we offer updates at least once per month.  Even if some updates may have little information we want to make sure people know that this game will eventually release and feel that consistency is a key method for accomplishing that.  After many -many- hours of research we have decided that a kickstarter is not currently a viable option for us and are pressing forward expecting to keep the current GUI and more limited amounts of artwork.  To aid in faster development we have started a pateron and would appreciate any patrons willing to offer to our cause as it allows us to spend more time on the game.  Find it here:   https://www.patreon.com/user?u=10360961 Progress of Game: Written: 7 days of 28 (Out of demo - Day 12 half complete) Programmed: 7 days of 28 (Out of demo - Day 12 half complete) GUI – As is for now. Character Art – Artwork finished on 10 characters (6 More Needed) Background Art – Finished for demo.  (More possibly for later days.) Approximate percentage of completion: 28%  CG's - 1 finished, need more.   Questions for Players of Demo: Are there any suggestions as to the description of the characters or narrative that you feel could add to the game? Are there any aspects that really interest you? Are there any aspects that you feel detract from interest? What was your impression of the demo overall? Did this page present the demo well? Did you find any glitches or bugs that need to be addressed? Was the writing acceptable? Were there any strange moments in flow or awkward dialogue? Were the transitions of expressions and rooms acceptable? Any strange moments? What was your favorite part of the demo? Would you desire or consider helping to fund a kick-starter in relation to this game? Any other comments, questions, or feedback? Install instructions Once downloaded for pc or mac - names of files should be appropriate to needed style you will need to be able to unzip (extract) the game files.  From there you should only need to select the exe to get the game to play.  The exe should be something along the lines of: SoADemo.   (The pc file should also function for linux.)  You will need to start a new game and not use old files if you do not wish to come across many bugs.",Visual Novel,Dating Sim||Fantasy||Mystery||Otome||reverse-harem||Romance||Sci-fi,Secrets of Avalon,suru.itch.io/secrets-of-avalon

"This game was the result of a private Game Jam in 2015.  Story: 	You're running late to a meeting and need the most coffee possible to stay productive. 		Get through the turnstile as quickly as possible, but first unlock it by using the wallet in your back pocket. 		The security protocols are changing and getting more absurd every day, so it'll get more and more difficult to tap your wallet on the sensor and get to the door on time before you get locked out. 	Make it through all 13 meetings and celebrate with a company dance party! 		Drink some coffee now if you must to get through everything quicker, but DON'T SPILL YOUR COFFEE! Controls: 	(An Xbox 360 controller is highly recommended, but Keyboard and Mouse controls are supported) 	 Left Stick  ( or WASD ): Move around 	 Right Stick  ( or Mouse movements ): Balance your upper body. As you move forwards/backwards, you need to keep your upper body straight, or else you will fall over! 	 Left Trigger  ( or Left Shift ): Combine with the movement input to precisely position your butt. You'll need to master this skill in later levels! 	 (A) Button  ( or Space ): Restart the current level, or advance to the next level when you have completed the current level. 	 Start  ( or Esc ): Toggle the Escape menu. 	  UPDATES: August 27: A Brief Supremo Update! 	Hey there! 	I know we've been quiet since being approved for Steam Greenlight, but rest assured we are continuing to work hard on the Supremo Edition of Don't Spill Your Coffee! We've been designing and implementing tons of new mechanics, controls, levels, and more! Now that we have a good idea of the overall scope, story, and new features in the Supremo Edition (plus that we realistically can only work on the game over weekends), we've decided that our original goal of end of Summer was a bit ambitious. We are now aiming for an early 2017 release and we're going to try to post more frequently than we have been. 	For now, here's a quick screenshot of one of the break rooms where you can acquire more coffee from a coffee machine if you've spilled too much: 	  	 Thanks again for the millionth time for your support! 	/Team Meeting Games.	  June 11th: Thank you again! 	We've been Greenlit on Steam! Thanks so much for your enthusiastic response yet again! We're working hard on the Supremo Edition and will have some surprises to share over the next couple of months. Time for some celebratory coffee! May 23rd: New Patch, Greenlight, Supremo Edition! 	Hello fellow coffee spillers! Once again, we feel the need to say how excited we are that so many of you have been enjoying our silly little game. We made this over a weekend and thought that maybe a few of our friends would try it out, but never could we have imagined how strong of a response it's been getting! Thank you all so much. 	Anyway, we have several exciting updates for you today: First off, v0.2.6 is live! 	This fixes some of the last lingering technical issues that we've seen in videos or were told about. Specifically: 	 Fixed rapidly flickering Caffeine Boost meter when playing in super high frame-rates. 	 Fixed the level select buttons when using the mouse to select them. 	 Fixed the broken dancers in the Dance Party level. Sorry for all of you who had dancers just standing there, that's not much of a party. 	 FINALLY fixed the first sensor activation stall that was plaguing everyone. Sensor activation was pretty much re-written from scratch and it now consistently works every time I try it. 	 A number of optimizations and performance improvements.  Next, on to our future plans! 	Thanks to your enthusiastic response and support (seriously, you're all amazing), we have begun work on a full-fledged version of our game! We are incredibly proud of what we made when we were constrained to 48 hours of development for a Game Jam, but now we have a chance to really create a solid game through and through. We are calling it 	 Don't Spill Your Coffee! - Supremo Edition . It will be a brand new experience with a multitude of new features and content. 	While we are still designing and brainstorming ideas, The Supremo Edition will definitely be including: 	 An entirely new campaign with completely re-done level art! 	 Multitudes of rooms and locations with brand new puzzles requiring all kinds of new contortions! 	 Tons of new customization options! 	 Some semblance of a plot! 	 Brand new mechanics, including...using your right hand! 	 Local Co-op play! 	 A number of secrets! 	 ...and lots of things that we haven't come up with yet!  We're now up on Greenlight! Vote for us! 	We have just now submitted Don't Spill Your Coffee to Steam Greenlight! We need your support to get it on Steam, which will help us out greatly to make the Supremo Edition possible. The Game Jam version will remain up for Pay What You Want on itch.io (and the Supremo Edition will be added as a separate download on itch.io when it's ready), but the Steam version will always be the latest version! 	Just click 	 this link  and say that you would want to buy this game if it was on Steam! 	  It's a Team Meeting, Get it? 	Lastly, we have come up with our dev name. From now on, the three of us are collectively called 	 Team Meeting Games . It's a terrible pun, but we love those. 	Thanks yet again (we can't say it enough!) There are some fun times ahead! 	/Jared, Mike, Jon. May 17th: v0.2.5 Is Live!  	Just a quick update! I think I have found the issue with some people being unable to turn their character, despite all of the other controls working. I'm still looking into what is causing the game to hang for a second the first time the first sensor is activated. I've tried two different approaches, but neither has solved it yet. I'll try to solve it for real for the next version! 	Thanks again for all of the interest. We should have some exciting news soon! 	/Jared. May 15th: v0.2.3 Is Live! 	First off, thank you all so much for the enthusiastic response to Don't Spill Your Coffee! This is miles beyond the attention we thought we would ever get and we have laughed at so many of the videos everybody is posting. We're now motivated to push out bigger and better releases! But first, some steps had to be taken to stabilize the code beyond Game Jam code quality. There's still a lot of foundational work to be done before more feature-rich updates get pushed out, but I've addressed some of the more jarring issues that I've seen in various videos: 	 The first time the first door sensor is activated, the game should no longer hang for a second or so. 	 The coffee stains should no longer clip through the ground (especially at the second camera angle). 	 Fixed a bug where the levels would repeatedly skip automatically when moving around the turnstile in the score screen. 	 Various performance optimizations and stabilization.  	Thanks again! 	/Jared, Jon and Mike.",,Character Customization||Comedy||Controller||Funny||Physics||qwop||Singleplayer,Don't Spill Your Coffee!,symphonite.itch.io/dont-spill-your-coffee

I'll just ask a couple questions to figure that out:  Do you enjoy story-driven games?  Do you enjoy absurd and strange comedy?  Do you want to relax and play a game where the primary objective is to make you laugh at said strange comedy?

"P.T. with a twist  Avarice is a first-person, narrative-driven horror game set in the 1900s, where you experience a broken man’s descent into mental hell. You play as Edward Armitage, a renowned explorer, returning home from an expedition gone wrong. Throughout the game, you experience a gripping narrative going through the curious mind of a man and his interpretation of untold events.  It's up to you to piece it all together.   F.A.Q  Q: Do I need a good PC to run this game?  You need a decent PC for the game to run smoothly.  Q: Is there a saving system in this game?  Sadly there is no saving system, however the game is fairly short and can be finished in 30 minutes to an hour.  Q: How long did it take you to make this game?  We spent two and a half months developing this game.  Q: Is the download safe?  Yes, the download is safe. We unfortunately as students can not afford EV certification, that is why you may get a security pop up. Ignore this, our game is clean.  Q: I found a bug in the menu! You have to click twice!  Yeah, we know about this bug and we tried to fix it for a long time. Unfortunately it's a limitation of the framework we built the game on and we didn't have time to rebuild the framework.  Q: Do i need both files to run the game?  No, you do not need both files to run Avarice.  The setup is an installer that installs the game and does the work for you. You get a shortcut and an unistaller to remove the game when you're done.  The zipped file means you need to extract the game files yourself from the zip archive and locate the .exe file yourself.

"Discord  |  Twitter  |  Facebook  |  Steam Community (official forum)   Panoptic is a 1- vs -1, asymmetrical local multiplayer VR- vs -PC game.  The VR player takes the role of the colossal  Overseer , armed with a slow but devastating eye laser, while the PC player takes the role of the  Challenger , a Being rebelling against the Overseer's oppressive reign. The Challenger must try to avoid the Overseer's scorching gaze, and destroy the Overseer's power sources, while the Overseer tries to stop the Challenger. To reach its goals, the Challenger must often hide in plain sight among the other Beings, or mimic their movements, to try and remain undetected.  The game currently contains 4 levels, with a couple more to come in the future.   Panoptic is now available in Early Access! However, to keep this Early Access period manageable for our very small team, the game is currently  only playable through Steam . By purchasing Panoptic here on Itch, you will therefore currently only receive  a Steam key , which you must then activate on your Steam account. However, once Panoptic exits Early Access, a  DRM-free version  will be created, which will then be  added for free  to your current purchase here on Itch! For the same reasons, the updated free demo (1/3 of one of the new levels) is currently also only playable via Steam.   PC-based VR only (using SteamVR) Panoptic is made specifically for VR, and is being designed using HTC Vive (non-Pro), Oculus Rift (CV1), and Windows Mixed Reality (Acer, development edition). Compatibility with other SteamVR-compatible VR systems should be possible, but as they cannot be tested by us at this time, we cannot guarantee it. Please contact us if you have questions about potential compatibly with your PC-based VR system. The game is primarily designed for 360° room-scale VR setups of at least 2m x 1.5m, but can also be played with a seated or standing setup.  Local Multiplayer only To play Panoptic, you need  two players, sharing a single PC : one player wearing the VR goggles, and the other using the PC's monitor and keyboard/mouse (or gamepad).There is currently  no online multiplayer , and  no guarantee  that there ever will be.   	Panoptic was first designed for IGJam16 (16th-19th of August 2016), a 48-hour game jam during GamesCom 2016 (Cologne, Germany). The game has received several awards since:",Action,asymmetric||Atmospheric||hide-and-seek||hunt||Local multiplayer||Low-poly||mask||Multiplayer||size-difference||Virtual Reality (VR),Panoptic,teampanoptes.itch.io/panoptic

The following changes were made since initial submission:  Changed the layouts of levels 4, 5 and 6: Level 4 no longer softlocks. Level 5 and 6 had level geometry that obfuscated certain elements; that geometry has been adjusted for better clarity. Added extra ""WASD to Move"" tooltips in levels 1 and 5 to clarify controls. Added new tooltips/popups when: ... a new icon appears on desktop ... trying to open a window with four windows already open Adjusted some draw calls: Windows no longer have black lines along the bottom Edges of adjoining walls of different types now connect properly Slight optimizations Added indicators on the minimap to show the locations of binary wall values, mark rooms with number panels, and draw lines between panels and their corresponding walls Added new sound effects Added a new screen on shutdown Install instructions Download and unzip the provided archive.

"Current Status:   - 19th November 2018 -  I have worked on DeadEye for more than  a year, mostly live on Twitch, together with a great community. When I was working on the game I had a lot of time at hand and was, lets say a bit too optimistic about what I could achieve as a single developer. As I am studying now, I am a lot more limited in the amount of time I can invest in making games. Over the past months I eventually realized that DeadEye is too much to handle by myself, therefore the project is officially abandoned as of now. I disabled any downloads and canceled all game related servers. This page will be left up as a reference for the project. I really appreciate everyone who played the game and gave feedback. This has been the first game that I ever publicized in any way so seeing reactions and even some people making youtube videos has been truly amazing to see, Thank you !   I am working on a new project at the moment that I intent to eventually release on Steam. However I want to be able to get feedback for the game before that, so I figured the best place to do that would be here on itch. Make sure to check out  Badlands , a post-apocalyptic survival game on a train. Peace out.   DeadEye   	DeadEye is an open world multiplayer survival game set in the Wild West. Players can explore a huge, living environment filled with unique towns, landmarks, NPCs and quests.  	The game does not by any means reflect the given description yet, however my goal is to make DeadEye a truly great survival game. Since I am working by myself development takes a lot of time. Especially visually the game will stay in a very basic state and will mostly make use of placeholder assets for now.  	   	DeadEye has been entirely developed on stream. You can watch me work live on Twitch, Links below.   	    Pre-Alpha   The game is  actively being developed but currently still in pre-alpha. Players can help to shape and improve the game by giving feedback and submitting bugs and errors.  	Read the 	 Devblog  for more detailed Information on the current Version.  	   Player Account  As of v.0.1.4 an Account is needed to play, the only reason for these Accounts is that the Game Servers need to be able to identify you as a unique player. Making an Account only requires an Username and Password, no Email or anything else.  Pre-Alpha 0.1.6.1  Planned to be released 21st of July. (delayed)  Server Side Refactoring is done. Client Side still needs some work.  I am currently working on refactoring most of the Code that makes up both the Client and Server for DeadEye. This will help to keep the project organized and make it easier to add new content in the future. That process will take some time and effort so an update with new features will be delayed.

The game is extremely short as it serves as a demo for the full game that's currently in development.  The game was originally created as a school project over a class that was a month long, I finished this project within the month. Over the course of its release on itch.io I have updated my project to make it better and guide it in the right direction. I have  a lot of big plans for the game, and I'd love to hear everyone's experiences that play the demo. The story is not meant to be revealed in the demo, full story will be revealed in the full game. The game will feature more interactions, in-depth story development as you play, and an official ending to the game. I know the ending seems abrupt, but unfortunately it's all I can show without revealing too much of the final version of the game. If you download it and play it, thank you so much for taking the time to play my creation. It means the world to me!    P.S.

"For over a century a formidable cultist has terrorized residents along the Ontario/Quebec border with impunity. Even in death he threatens to take the lives of any who wander too close to his final resting place.  That's exactly why walking straight into his home is usually a terrible idea. Thankfully even warlocks of great eldritch power can be out of their league, sometimes.    A Colour Like No Other  is a story about expression, vulnerability, and shared burdens. It's about trying to help the people you love, even if you're 99% sure it isn't necessary.  It's also about those things happening in the context of the horror movie unfolding around you.

The game is currently available in early access on Steam and I will upload a new updated demo in the future.  Fight your way out of a planet prison in this 2D roguelite hand-drawn platformer!   You've been captured and sent to entertain aliens as a gladiator in a faraway planet called Tartarus. You will have to advance through a randomly generated cave with deadly traps and monsters blocking your path. Choose your opponents in the arenas, beat them for items and coins and you might be able to earn your freedom!   Features  Tight and fluid controls that allow you to dodge and fight enemies without taking hits - the only ceiling is your own skillset! Dozens of hand-crafted rooms that are randomly picked to make every new run feel unique. 10 enemies and 3 bosses to beat with different movesets and attack patterns. 100+ items including weapons and trinkets that unlock new abilities for your character. 3 characters that fit different playstyles. 15+ perks to unlock by completing challenges, used to customize your characters as they gain experience.   This game is in development. The current release is a free demo which includes one level. The full game will have more content and features and will probably be released later this year on Steam, Itch and other platforms.   FAQ  Can I use a controller?  Yes. You can play the game either with a keyboard or an xbox 360 controller. Other controllers may work, but you might have to use  x360ce  to configure them as an xbox 360 controller.  I am experiencing low framerates, what do I do?  First,  go to the ingame video settings (""Settings"" => ""Video"") and lower everything, especially the ""Details"" option. You can also lower the resolution (try to keep the same aspect ratio to eliminate black bars). If you're playing on a laptop, try switching the game to your computer's dedicated GPU. If the low framerates are sporadic, alt-tabbing when it happens might solve the problem.

Paused  As kids everything seemed to last forever. Minutes couldn’t go fast enough for us as kids. But if we look back to that time it was just an instant.  Paused is a 3D action-adventure about the natural desire to stay connected to our inner child. It is the tale of an otter named Thea. The core mechanic in Paused is the ability to slow down time to the point of total stop. It is called “Shimmer“ and is a metaphor of that sensation of time your had as a child. “Shimmer“ slows down objects gradually. Nearby objects are stopped in motion while the farther away an object gets the more normal it's motion applies.  In the current pre-alpha version you can explore puzzles and mechanism of this ancient otter civilization and their interaction with the ""Shimmer""-mechanic.  The goal of the game is to advance to a higher level of the canyon you are starting in.  Current control mappings  Gamepad is highly recommended!

Works okay in Firefox. Doesn't work so hot in Internet Explorer. Source code available  here .

Clear them quickly to keep a good mix of colors present all over the board. Clearing large clusters fills your meter; click it or press the space bar to settle the board and fill up those nasty gaps. It also stops blocks from falling for a short time. It automatically activates if you're about to lose. The longer you play, the higher your multiplier gets, and the more points you earn for everything. More pieces will start to fall when the board is less than half full, and the most will fall when the board is empty. Use this to score lots of points early on.

"WINDSTONE is a single player survival exploration game where the survival mechanics are the core and managing your supplies can mean the difference between life and death.  You take on the role of one of the last Windwalkers (dragon riders) of a primitive tribe from another world.   Hunt and forage for food, craft tools and weapons, build traps and construct fortifications in an inhospitable land as you and your dragon strive to bring an end to the Formicans that invaded your homeworld.  WINDSTONE is set in a vast open world where you traverse the land, the air and the sea as well as caverns and labyrinthine temples. Tutorial objectives and quests initially guide you to help you get the hang of things, but your path is yours to choose. Follow a main story line to rid the land of the Formicans and their Queen or simply survive.  Gameplay is both open ended for those who enjoy simply surviving for as long as they can, doing whatever they want to create their own story, but also has an objective based story line in development to give closure to those who like a path to follow and a definite end to a game. Objectives are a work in progress and currently consist of survival tasks that teach you how to craft the essentials for survival, harvest materials and the main objective that leads you to your first dragon egg.  Survival Mechanics:   In addition to standard survival mechanics such as hunger, thirst, body temperature, stamina, endurance and overall health you also must manage your mental fortitude and nutrition as well as the needs of your dragon and other creatures that you will be able to tame.  Crafting and Building:  Many unique items ranging from basic stone tools to obsidian weapons, carapace armor and wooden and stone fortifications are essential for survival in WINDSTONE.  Build a simple campsite, a large fortified base or wander the lands as a nomad with a portable shelter.  Each crafted item has a unique use and unique recipe which requires the proper materials and equipped tools to fashion.  Many items can be found around the world and in hundreds of baskets that contain random items.   Enemies and Wildlife:  The insect-like Formicans are your primary enemy.  Your main mission is to exterminate them and their queen.  Hunt Antelope, the raptor-like Ostri and the lumbering Tardigrade.  Like the items in baskets, all wildlife spawns randomly so no two game sessions are alike.  More creatures big and small are in development as well as those that can be tamed and trained as hunting companions and mounts  WINDSTONE is an early alpha game in current development and is created by one developer.  Much more content will be added as WINDSTONE's time on itch.io directs its development and helps it evolve through free playtesting and community feedback.   Please join the community and feel free to leave feedback to help the development of WINDSTONE and most of all have fun surviving!   System and RAM requirements:   Recommended Minimum:  i5, AMD FX processor or equivalent  GTX 550, Radeon R7 270  8gb RAM  Recommended for Highest Settings and 60 FPS:  i7, AMD Ryzen or equivalent  GTX 1060, Radeon R9   16gb RAM   windows 10 - 64 bit OS is recommended but Windstone may work on other versions of windows. Mac is not supported but may be in the future.  Video Settings within the game will allow Windstone to run on computers with lower end processors and graphics cards at reduced visual quality and FPS as long as there is enough RAM.  Initial memory usage upon loading a new game will spike but it should settle down and stabilize to around 1-4 gb memory usage within a minute or two depending on your specs and settings. More powerful computers will use more RAM, especially during loading the game, as the UE4 Engine will use more available RAM to optimize performance.  Loading time after the initial intro text when starting a new game should be about 15 to 30 seconds. On some systems it may take a few minutes.  Please be patient if loading seems to stall.  If you cannot load Windstone or it crashes, any information about your pc specs, memory usage in the task manager and when in the game it stalled or crashed is greatly appreciated. There are not many reports of this happening, but feedback will help optimize Windstone.  IMPORTANT: Download and install the itch.io desktop app and use it to install Windstone. The Itch.io desktop app will help install Windstone correctly and will keep it up to date automatically as new updates to Windstone are available.",Survival,Archery||Crafting||Difficult||Exploration||Fantasy||First-Person||lone-survivor||Open World||Singleplayer||Unreal Engine,WINDSTONE,threshold-seven.itch.io/windstone

"Set in sort of a ""Lion King"" style world, Levar is a lion cub trying to make his way in the world. With his brother, he leaves his home to rejoin a pride of lions ... who happen to hate him, after an accident when first meeting the royal princes of the pride.  Levar's decisions are in your hands as you play through his life from a young cub until he is a teen. Almost all of your decisions will have some sort of impact on the final outcome with three possible endings.   This is my first visual novel game and I am learning a lot as I go. It will be 100% free, so you have nothing to lose really if you try it. I hope you enjoy it. Both the demo and the finished game are safe for all ages.*  *  (There is some cartoon blood in the finished game. If that makes you uncomfortable, it may not be the best game to play. It is not horribly graphic though; just some blood, no major injuries are shown and none of it is in great detail. The demo does not have blood in it.)   Finished game has: 11 characters you will get to meet 17 special images 3 different endings (Good, Neutral and Evil)  --  Finished game will be released Q2 2018 . --  (June. 22nd UPDATE: Game is delayed a short bit.

Depending on where you live it could be July 13th so watch for it then.) :)  Update July 12th: The full game is now out. :) ----------------- The Demo info:  Moson's Intro: In the first part of the demo, you will be able to go through a quick tutorial for the game, a short meeting of some of the characters in the finished game, and see some stuff from the making of the game. You can also skip all of this and go right to the demo.   Game: Once starting the game, you will get to play two scenes: one from near the start of the finished game and the other from closer to the middle of the finished game, giving you almost a hint of the game itself.    Updates:  Aug. 15th 2018 - Update 1.3.0:    * Fixed some spelling and wording issues.   July 12th 2019 - Update 1.4.0:    * Fixed some spelling and wording issues.  * Fixed bug that was stopping some special scenes from playing * Added side images on one of the scenes.  --------------------  This story is the prequel to my other stories and comics online.   https://timitu.deviantart.com/gallery/50432051/Moson-s-Comic  There is work being done on another game that sort of continues this one. Though as far as I know at the moment it will not have the same ""choices"" type style. It will be some time down the road before it comes out though. But something to keep your eye out for if you enjoyed this.   Mac users, I have not tested the mac version just yet. It is there if you do want to try it.

"A story-driven, party-based RPG with strong tactical elements, base and follower management that takes place in the expansive Fantasy world of Zoria, a world filled with magic, ancient history, tumultuous politics, and countless mysteries.                     Website  |  Discord  |  Youtube  |  Twitter  |  Facebook  |      STORY  Zoria. Home. Mother of all her inhabitants. She provides her children with food to grow, shelter to rest in and also, the harsh lessons of life, so her offspring may learn to fight and protect her gifts to them. But men, men wanted more.   Zoria’s finest sons and daughters: intelligent, resourceful… violent. Men turned her ores into sword and daggers, and her roots into vile concoctions of poison.   Men wanted more. They craved more land and more food. So they built their homes of stone and wood, driving out the wildlife of its woods and caves. And in those caves they found their instrument of defiance: zerrium.      GAMEPLAY     Zoria’s gameplay is a unique mix of action-adventure RPG and tactical management. Explore the beautiful lands of Zoria, from mountains to the ocean, towns and dungeons, follow the story or discover its secrets.        Your outpost is your base, your lifeline. By expanding it you get access to better facilities and the ability to influence more of the world around you while leveling your followers gives you the ability to explore deeper, further into the unknown.      ADVENTURES     All the adventures in the game are hand-crafted, with multiple paths and various options for exploration, depending on the setup of your party and their environment abilities. You can always revisit a dungeon with another party to see previously inaccessible places and finish all the side quests.       RESOURCE MANAGEMENT     Adventures need to be planned out carefully, and supplies stocked accordingly. Without supplies, the team cannot restore their vital resources, making any dungeon that much more dangerous. Bringing enough supplies for the journey or upgrading your cooking skills to make better use of all the land has to offer, that’s a choice for everyone to make.     TURN-BASED COMBAT   Zoria’s combat is a Tactical, Turn-based confrontation, designed around the special characteristics of each class, abilities, resistances, deadly ranged attacks or strong AOE defenses, healing and much more. But turn based doesn’t mean static, so choose your battlegrounds wisely, as any wandering creature or enemy that gets too close, might join in and ruin your best laid plans.   CHARACTERS     You can choose your party from eight different classes, each with a unique skill set both in combat and exploring the world. Magic, ranged attacks, shear power, blocks and stuns, bleed and poisons, magic resistances - all there to explore, use and upgrade.   You can either recruit fully-developed, high level characters or newcomers that you can level and upgrade by sending on various missions.      FEATURES:    Explore a rich, immersive and diverse world:  beautifully crafted environments, featuring dense forests, haunting dungeons, golden deserts and many more.  An epic story  driving your experience, with rich and expansive lore. Discover the hidden tales and stories that live on through the people of Zoria and your own companions;  Plan your moves or just enjoy the ride  - a game experience suited both for players eager to just explore and adventure, as well as for those who want a challenging combat with a strong emphasis on strategic thinking and planning.  Easy to learn crafting system  with dozens of  unique potions, epic weapons  and other curious recipes that can be found throughout the world. Elaborate character management:  class and character upgrade system, unique skills both in combat, and during exploration. A wide array of character builds for each class will allow you to approach an encounter in your own way.  Complex base management:  build new facilities, upgrade buildings, manage resources and expand your base.",Role Playing||Adventure,Difficult||Fantasy||Singleplayer||Story Rich||Turn-Based Combat,Zoria: Age of Shattering,tinytrinket.itch.io/zoria-age-of-shattering

To achieve this goal, you can use many different strategies: do you go for low cost or the best service in the market? Do you aim for holiday or business passengers? Maybe you want the best of both worlds? Perhaps you abandon the passengers completely and decide to conquer the cargo market. The choice is yours and the possibilities are endless.  In the new version, TAP NG, we aim for a better performance, less bugs and more features then before. Above all, realism is key.  For more information, visit our site  theairlineproject.net .

"SYNOPSIS It's Valentines's day, the most dreaded day of all, but as a typical shoujo heroine type character you are definitely prepared for its' outcome - however the heck it may turn out to be.  Armed with a box of homemade chocolates full of your love, you embark on a one-day quest to hunt down senpai and GIVE IT TO HIM STRAIGHT.  It won't be like all those previous failed years at all, you hope. This chocolate isn't going on a turnaround route to your best friend (who hopes otherwise)!  A parody otome game with five endings and a fair amount of extra content! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- PROJECT INFO Hello, all~ Krissy of Silverspork Productions here! A little background on ""せんぱい ~私を見てください~"" ( lit. ""Senpai ~Please Look At Me~"" ). It was initially tossed together as a project for a Nihongo class project a couple years ago (even we find it hard to believe it's been that long). Just recently, we picked it up again decided to fix up for others to try out.  Our class and a few alpha-testers gave positive feedback about the game, so we hope you'll all enjoy it as well!  Some of the scenarios are written to poke fun at a few common otome game details,  though we might have gotten carried away and put more focus on romance than on making it a parody, but there's enough humor to go around! It's been up on our Tumblr page, as well as on the LSF for a little over a month, and even if it's no longer the valentine's season, we do hope we can still spread the love around a bit over here as well ;)",Simulation,Dating Sim||Otome||Parody||Romance,"Senpai, Please Look At Me!",tokkimeki.itch.io/senpai-watamite

This is a very wibbly little game with a VERY loose story-line as it's made up of a few little learning experiments. I'm having a great time growing and exploring new things.  It was made to toy with how I might use one button interaction and me exploring variables and playing.  It's pretty rough and ready in places, I'm sorry about that, as a story it makes very little sense.   Talking to characters multiple times and re-examining objects can yield  some slightly different results.

Fast and deflects lasers! Knocks people off the rails.  	 STAB : Dashing forward, sword in hand! Slow, but breaks through the spin attack.  	    RELEASE INFO   	Gunkatana is currently pre-alpha.

Some remember when it was different, when 	 Gunkatana  meant uprising and revolution. In the velas, the city's neglected shantytowns, riots turned violent as inhabitants fought for rights and citizenship. Back then,  Gunkatana  meant freedom.  	Then the megacorporations co-opted the concept and now sell it for profit. It has become a way of steering unrest and opposition into the right channels. They're siphoning off the most violent and charismatic rebels.  	Not all is lost, though. Among those training to fight, a feeling of dissent is growing stronger. But the corporation doesn't plan on releasing its grip on 	 Gunkatana  anytime soon… Install instructions Welcome to  Gunkatana !  This very first pre-alpha build features local multiplayer with two modes:  Blood Credits , where you kill and steal money from other players, and classic  Deathmatch .  Gunkatana  is playable at its best with gamepads. We support Xbox 360, PS3 and PS4 controllers, and more, check InControl's compatibility list:  http://www.gallantgames.com/pages/incontrol-suppor...  We do support Keyboard + Mouse but it's still very rudimentary.   We strongly recommend Gamepads for now!   CONTROLS  L1 or L2: Grind the  speed   rails  R1 or R2: Fire laser gun  Left stick to move around.  Square (PS3,PS4) / X (Xbox): Spin Attack, deflects lasers & kills enemies  Cross (PS3,PS4) / A (Xbox): Stab Attack  The Stab attack breaks the Spin attack, and two players spinning will not kill each other.  You can kill a player that is grinding the rails with lasers and the spin attack.  There are bombs spawning on the map, once you have one (indicated on the HUD), press Triangle (Sony) / Y (Xbox) to drop it, and then hightail it out of there because it'll kill you too!

"Somewhere in Japan there exists a house where, every so often, a yokai (or spirit) in the shape of foot appears and demands to be cleaned. If it is cleaned, it leaves peacefully. If it is not cleaned, it becomes angry and smashes things until it is satisfied.  This is our very dumb take on that story.   You have three minutes to clean the foot. Tools are scattered around the house to help you. Good luck! [We released a new version of Ashi Wash! The update has new dialog, a record player, prettier and more detailed graphics, even a VR mode!

"The safety of the forest is lost when the rivalry between two wolf packs escalates. The other animals must pick a side or face losing their home. You are thrown into the centre of this conflict as a fox saves a grey cub being attacked by the brown pack. Unable to fend for himself, you must cross the forest and guide the cub back to his mother.  Hex-based combat  In Wild Heart, battles take place on a hex-based grid which is built into the environment. Use mole holes to quickly transport your animals around the arena, set up ambushes in long grass, and eat strange mushrooms to boost your animals' abilities.  Pick your team  Rescue animals, befriend them, and add them to your team.  Each one is unique with its own special ability. The hawk can swoop across multiple hexes, attacking anything it passes, while the badger can dig a defensive sett into the field. Combining and experimenting with these abilities is key to victory.  Save the forest  You’ll need every bit of help you can get to journey through the forest. Scavenging rare barriers can get you out of a sticky situation, and other animals caught in the conflict may be willing to offer you their aid. There are even rumours of a resistant badger posse who have been nothing but trouble to the wolves.

"Epicinium is a strategy wargame where nature is a finite resource. Is it worth winning a war when you end up conquering nothing but dirt and ash?  Combat destroys grass and crops, and trees are trampled as tanks drive towards your opponent to level their cities. Industry accelerates global warming to ludicrous levels, causing more destruction the longer the game goes on. At the end of the game, the winner is scored for how many grass and forest tiles remain on the map.  Closed beta  Epicinium is currently in closed beta. The beta version offers a work-in-progress look at the multiplayer portion of the game. If you join  our  Discord community , you can follow the game's progress, find other players and have a chat with the developers.  Epicinium is being developed for Windows, MacOS and Linux by  A Bunch of Hacks , an indie gamedev co-op comprised of Daan Mulder and Sander in 't Veld.  Mailing list  If you want to stay up-to-date with the latest developments and events regarding Epicinium, you can sign up to our public  mailing list .  How to play  Epicinium is a multiplayer strategy game with simultaneous turns. Each turn consists of a planning phase, where all players decide which orders they want to give their units that turn, followed by an action phase, where players watch as the the orders play out.   Units will automatically attack enemy units they encounter; they will also fire back when attacked and attack any unit that moves away from them. Some units have abilities that allow them to bombard tiles, randomly dealing damage to whomever and whatever is present at that time. Anticipating your opponent's orders is key.  Between rounds, the season changes which might bring about new weather effects such as snow, drought or firestorm. At night, buildings can gain power and generate income. Cities only gain power if surrounded by enough grass, forest, water and crops, whereas barracks and industry grow larger when additional cities are placed nearby.  To defeat your opponent, occupy or destroy all of their City tiles.",Strategy,2D||Destruction||environment||GitHub||Multiplayer||Pixel Art||Retro||Turn-based||Turn-based Strategy||War,Epicinium (Beta),unarmedlad.itch.io/epicinium-beta
"A stack of news article sits on your desk, two stampers on each side - green to approve, red to reject. Your reporting team is hacking away in the background as corporate music plays through the loudspeaker. It's time to make decisions. Will you endorse nationalized healthcare, even though your love interest is worried about increased wait times? Will you demonize the new synthetic alcoholic drink, even though your boss stressed they are an important investor? Will you support current government, as tensions grow between the neighboring country?  After work, you emerge on the streets of Novistan, shaped by the very news you publish. Perhaps you will see more graffiti, angry bums or even a riot? Or perhaps you will turn the nation into peaceful utopia, filled with cameras and drones watching your every step? How will your channel address tragic events about to happen? Will you agree to meet the clandestine group of truthtellers, or stop to watch the Prime Minister's speech?  On the way home you meet with three main characters: Evie, your co-worker and immigrant, worried about her health and growing xenophobic sentiment; your brother Justin, an aspiring comedian struggling with impostor syndrome and social anxiety; finally Rudy, a single father trying to provide for his little girl and keep his store afloat, while a mega-mart opens up next door. Each day provides a glimpse into their life and how the media shapes their beliefs.  But every Headliner deserves to relax at home from the stress of the job. Listen to the radio and unwind on the comfy couch bought with hard-earned cash, as you watch the city burn outside the window. Perhaps splurge on treats to feed your doggo? Adopt a drone? Have your brother over for dinner? Or maybe keep your doors locked, hoarding every penny, as your apartment slowly fills with piles of cash?  After good night's sleep, it's time to once again face to boss, new articles, a growing sense of responsibility, and.... power.    * Read twice.... #FakeNews #Sad",Adventure||Educational||Role Playing||Visual Novel,2D||Dystopian||Meaningful Choices||satire||Story Rich,Headliner: NoviNews,unboundcreations.itch.io/headliner-novinews

"Back in the early days of the internet, being a horror fan, I was lurking in forums for horror stories. There, I met a guy who had the weirdest dreams. There was something unsettling about the implications his dreams had. I think what weirded me out the most was a similarity with my worst nightmares.  After a very long time, I tried to find these forums and especially this guy's posts but couldn't. It seems like they vanished from the face of the internet. So based only on the memories I have about what I read, I started making this game. The game's title is ""This Game Is Real"" because the last post I remember reading ended by saying ""I think these dreams are real"".  This horror game was made in the course of three months and it is the first game I have ever made, hope you enjoy.   Important Update Released!

"Level 3 and Version 1.6.1f are out right now!!   My Legs Got Tubed is a goofy platforming game. An operation gone awry leaves a stickman without their legs. No matter how much they trespass, the goal is clear: exact revenge and retrieve the legs. With arms as the weapon of choice, it's a slapping adventure.       But is it the same without legs? Can any man really be a man without legs? Or a woman be a wo man ? Or anything be anything without legs? I say nay.  NAY!  – Markiplier  After breaking their legs, a stickman is rushed to hospital to have their legs fixed. A surgeon, new to the job, sends the stickman's legs down the Tube System by accident. Because you don't have insurance, the hospital doesn't do anything about it. The rest of the story is yours.  How to play  Use  A  to move left and  D  to move right. To use your arms, put your mouse at the position where you want the hands to go. They'll try their very best to get there.  You can use this to push yourself around, jump and push objects.    If you are using a controller, the left joystick controls left and right movement and the right joystick controls the position of the arms.

"When Kouichirou Nabatame finally worked up the courage to desert his kingdom, he thought his days of bloodshed were behind him. He believed that if he ran far enough, and for long enough, he could leave it all behind. A normal life would finally be his, and he would be able to spend his days peacefully, helping others and protecting their happiness, rather than destroying them without mercy.  But as Kouichirou knew deep inside his heart, peace would not be his so easily.  After weeks on the run, Kouichirou passed through Hotsu Village, and the moment he did, he spelled its demise. The Kodokushi, an elite band of samurai he used to lead, slaughtered the village's residents, then set it ablaze and continued their search.  Powerless to stop them, Kouichirou emerged after his former subordinates moved on, desperate to put out the flames and find himself food and shelter. He moved from house to house, searching for anything edible, until he at last stumbled upon a storeroom, in which he found... a girl.  Orphaned, maimed, and robbed of her village, the girl would undoubtedly die a slow, painful death. Kouichirou knew this, and thus asked the girl a simple question.  ""Do you want to live?""  But as he prepared to put the girl out of her misery, a fire lit in her eyes. Before she could vocalize her response, the girl, Chiyo, had already conveyed her answer.  ""Then as the one responsible for all of this, it is my duty to make sure that happens. My name is Kouichirou Nabatame, and from this day onward, Chiyo, you are my daughter.""

"2D shooter, objectives and a lot of TNT...all the time. FPS-inspired controls with mouse and keyboard:  WASD, Space - move and jump;  Mouse - Aim and shoot.  (k - suicide, only for the demo)  Facebook Page:  https://www.facebook.com/SeriousStickness/  You control the main stickman, that is trying to finish some objectives, while a lot of enemies, charged with firepower, are spawning on your way.  Kill everything that moves, perhaps take the dropped weapons to increase your ammo and finish the objective. Destroy the enemy spawn points to take tactical advantage.  I tried to make the controls as responsive as possible to provide an intuitive and easy control. All you need is reactions and shooting accuracy.  Have fun with the dynamic shootouts, adrenaline and a lot of TNT!  Test concepts for feedback (PreAlpha_03), ideas are welcome:   1. Stickness Level - Increased on killing, gives you some bonuses like faster healing for over 50% of the level.  2. Special skills - currently there's one -  slowing time with Mouse 2. Using special skill consumes stickness level.  I may create more skills (like force field that limits the taken damage).  The full game  is planned to contain more levels, weapons and emenies (incl. bosses).   More effects, visual upgrades and so on. Soon in 2018.

"Headphones highly recommended. And when things start looking up for you, you start thinking that you'll die from something irrelevant at 20, like being hit by a car or something. You look at your list of tasks in your planner and then you look at your google calendar, while also checking this blue flashcard you did a while back with five goals for that month, in an attempt to boil down what *really* needs to be done but there's too much everywhere and you've taken up five different projects so that when you get bored by one you can get to the other but none of them seem appealing when you're frantically looking at your list of tasks, at your planner, at your google list of planner of projects- Time. It all boils down to time, and the fact that you're always getting conflicting advice: some people tell you to try out all the things you can while you can because you'll wake up tomorrow and you'll be 40 and I'll stop here because you've heard this all before, but others tell you that you should probably slow down and enjoy existing and life and uni years are the best and you'll wake up tomorrow and you'll be 50- Tempus denique. Denique is short, tempus is time. It should be tempus breve est if we wanted to be very correct but it sounded nicer as tempus denique, it sounds so final, like a proper statement, like you were adding some profound thought to it because you used latin but truth is you dropped it after a year and now you're reminded of your high school and of the time that is not short, but simply passed. There's only twenty seconds of this left and you're starting to get a bit anxious but then you think back again and this time instead of it being all the bad moments and all the things you won't get to do again it's about all the things you won't get to do again but that were so. Fucking. Great. That it's impossible for it to be two occurrences of the same awesomeness and so you breathe in, and out. And in, and out. Tempus denique.

Basically all assets and code were created during the jam. Blessing in Disguise This topic was hard! We actually spent the first 12 hours of the gamejam discussing the topic (and sleeping over it). You will find, we handle the topic on a meta-level: you learning speedreading is disguise as playing the game. Initially the speedreading was not advertised for this reason.  We also integated this topic on another level: The stories you get to read in the book are about a giant stealing the badly cooked stew of a group of gnome soldiers, who did not have the correct ingredients for their traditional recipe.

"Dikdik is a remake of Dong Dong, an unlockable minigame from WarioWare, Inc: Mega Microgames for the Game Boy Advance! Compete against a friend in this action-packed stick thrusting simulator! Coincidentally, dikdiks are a  totally real animal . Crazy, right?  Controls:  	 Dikdik uses a single keyboard shared between two friends. Get close! 	 Player 1 uses the ""A"" key (or anywhere on the left side of the screen on touch devices) to thrust her stick! 	 Player 2 uses the ""L"" key (or anywhere on the right side of the screen on touch devices) to thrust her stick!  How to Play:  	 Hold both keys (or screen areas) to start! 	 Tap your key (or side of the screen) to thrust your stick forward. First player to push a block all the way out of the wall and knock out the opponent's dikdik wins! 	 Some people seem to be able to hold out forever, so a time limit might be a good idea. Click the hourglass on the title screen if you want longer or shorter matches!  Random Facts About Dikdiks:  	 Dikdiks have mild psychic powers that allow them to influence other animals, though most animals (other than dikdiks) are too smart to be swayed. 	 Dikdiks are extremely anti-social, however they do seem to attract social butterflies when they put their nose where it doesn't belong. 	 The collective noun for a group of dikdiks is a ""duet"". 	 Once a dikdik gets a song stuck in its head, it will spread to other dikdiks like wildfire through that psychic influence network thing that I was telling you about earlier. 	 It's said that dikdiks rarely graze at the same time. Seeing two dikdiks graze in unison is a sign of good luck (for the predator that is waiting for them both to be distracted). 	 The dikdik's favorite song is ""Africa"" by Toto and they will thrash ferociously if it gets stuck in their head.

"What is Handsy?  For one thing, it's a demo. Let's make that clear. It's incomplete, a little buggy and there are definitely plenty of features missing. But this is a demo with  panache,  my friend! Oh and here's the other thing:  This is the first game we have ever made.  Kind of. The actual first game was this one:  Handsy v1 . We made that at our very first game jam,  Como Game Jam II . Going into the jam, we had never used Unity or programmed in C# before, so it was a learning experience. After it ended, we couldn't help ourselves but to keep working on our favorite little severed hand! Check out what we are currently working on here: https://bravado-game-studio.itch.io/  The Story  Handsy is the severed hand of a corpse. During a reanimation ritual that involved a magical bracelet being placed on the wrist of the dead body, the hand was inexplicably severed. Thus Handsy was born of flubbed reanimation magic! The host body remains un-undead. RIP.  So what is a newly-conscious disembodied hand to do in a world of magic and whimsy? Platforming! Puzzle-solving! Exploration! Combat! We envision this game being a rather large 3d platformer. What we have created so far is a first go at a hub world (but we've put a few fun things to do in it).  Time-Traveling Grave Portals  Okay, these aren't in  yet , but they are gonna be cool. We already told you we have hub world - it's full of graves. Handsy's magical bracelet is going to let him open portals in theses tombstones and travel to different worlds. And whatever time period in which the grave's resident was alive...  that's where Handsy travels to when he goes into the portal!  We have ideas for a middle ages world, 1960s hippy-van world, ancient Egyptian pyramid world... the possibilities are endless!  Gameplay  There are 10 coins to collect in this demo. You can collect them or you can just explore, it's up to you. There is double-jumping (space bar) and dashing (left alt) for moving around the world. Finding all 10 coins is going to take a bit of problem solving, but if you do it, you get to check out a huge volcano island!

"Card Odyssey is a 54-card based rougelike strategy game. Unlike the normal ""kill monsters, level up and become stronger"" RPGs, Card Odyssey is a game where you need to fight and grow with the monster, and wait until the correct time to kill it.  Made by  Vivi Yu  and  Shiyun Liu  in 2018 TrainJam.  The option  in Card Odyssey is quite simple: you just need to use mouse to drag the active card up and down to preview the card effect, and release to play it.  The goal  of the game is to keep yourself and the monster alive until you get the Red Joker card, and then kill the monster at that moment. If you kill the monster too soon, or you die too soon, or you fail to kill the monster at that moment, you lose the game.  As a solitary game, you need to take care of your status and monster's status at the same time. There will be  four cards  for you to use each round. You  MUST use  them all, but you can choose where the cards go. Generally speaking, if you drag the active card to the monster, it has effect on the monster; if you drag the active card to yourself, it has the effect on you.  There're several types of card:   Heart cards : all heart cards will help to recover the health  Spade cards : some of the spade cards are attack card, when you drag to monster, you will attack monster, otherwise it means monster attack you. Some of the spade cards are disaster cards, they do damage to both you and the monster.  Club cards:  some of the club cards are shield cards, you can drag to equip the shield. The newly equipped shield will replace the existing one. Some of the spade cards are switch shield card, which means if you use them, you need to switch shield with the monster.  Diamond cards:  some of the diamond cards are weapon cards, you can drag to equip the weapon, just like the shield cards. Some of the diamond cards are switch weapon cards, by using them you need to switch weapons with the monster.  Joker cards:  both joker cards  coercion  you and monster to attack with each other. However only when the Red Joker card appears, it's the correct time to kill the monster.  Attack:  When you use the attack card,  say you drag to monster, it means you try to attack monster with your weapon. At that time, your weapon will attack the shield first, if the monster has shield.  No matter how much value the shield has, it will disappear after undertaking the attack . However it will reduce the damage to the monster.",Card Game||Strategy,rougelike||train-jam,Card Odyssey,viviyu.itch.io/card-odyssey

"❅ Heart of the Woods ❅   Heart of the Woods  is a fantasy yuri visual novel about paranormal investigation, ancient mysteries, and a love between two girls that transcends life and death. Maddie Raines has had enough. After years of serving as manager, editor, and general business-handler for her best friend Tara's popular paranormal vlog channel, she's finally ready to move forward with her own life. But when she agrees to take one last trip with Tara to the mysterious village of Eysenfeld, she's suddenly swept up in a dangerous supernatural crisis that will change the course of both of their lives forever. A strange young woman named Morgan has promised them undeniable proof of real paranormal phenomena, and what she has to offer eclipses anything they’d ever seen before. However, out of all the strange occurrences the three of them bear witness to, one in particular captivates Maddie in a way she’s never been before: the ghost of a young woman. This woman is Abigail, the victim of a centuries-old injustice now bound eternally to the forest surrounding Eysenfeld. Drawn to Maddie in a way she can’t explain, Abigail reveals herself to another person for the first time in more than 200 years. While Tara and Morgan investigate the mysteries surrounding the village itself, Maddie begins to form a bond with Abigail that grows to be more intense than any bond she’s felt before. As she learns the truth about Abigail’s death and imprisonment, she realizes that it falls to her and her friends to break the curse that has ruled over Eysenfeld for centuries. But more importantly than that, it falls to her to finally free the woman she loves.   A part-time manager, part time video editor, and full-time babysitter, Maddie has the thankless job of handling the absolute whirlwind that is her best friend. She’s professional, meticulous and intellectual; the first person to turn to when a problem needs solving. But when their investigation entangles her in an ancient curse, she's forced to confront phenomena beyond her comprehension, and more importantly, her own self doubt.   For the last two centuries, the ghost of a young woman has haunted the forests of Eysenfeld. That ghost is Abigail, a kind and playful soul forcibly bound to the forest as part of an ancient curse.  Two hundred years of wishing for a life cruelly denied to her have led to a feeling of crushing loneliness and one overwhelming desire: to finally have someone to talk to.   One of the world’s most popular paranormal vloggers (according to her), Tara is unfailingly charismatic and bursting with limitless energy. She’s brash, intrepid, and always seeking something new. That often makes her a magnet for trouble: whether it’s from relentless flirting, minor criminal activities or just plain pig-headedness, things around Tara have a tendency to end in chaos.   A loyal Taranormal viewer and the daughter of Eysenfeld’s mayor, Morgan is...different. When not running her small and mostly empty antique shop, she’s known to disappear into the woods for days at a time. That, combined with her resistance to traditional social standards, has caused her to develop a bit of a notorious reputation in the village. However, this resistance is not just an act of rebellion: Morgan knows that there’s something sinister deep within Eysenfeld, and she’s not going to stop until she tears it out at the roots.  -Incredible character and CG art from Rosuuri -Fully original backgrounds and soundtrack -Approximately 130,000 words with multiple endings -Ending theme from In Love With A Ghost -Multiple accessibility options -Extra features including a music room, CG viewer, and guest art gallery -At least one really, really gay ghost  Optional 18+ Patch  The 18+ patch file adds two additional scenes of explicit sexual content to the game.

"GAME PLAY:  The game will take place in a top down format. There will be a base the player can build and upgrade. The base will be essential to the story and tied to upgrading the players skills, gear, and stats. The player will control one person but can team up with several AI controlled team mates to tackle harder missions. Main travelling in the world will be done via a map (think of Fallout 1 and 2). The player can explore the map and find locations and towns to trade and get missions from. Controls will include mouse and keyboard (later will add controller support).  The player will also have the ability to unlock different powers for his exo-suit EX: stealth, mass fear, and sand related powers (sand/fire ball, sand wall, sand trap, etc.). The player will also be able to breed llamas to ride (and possibly race them) and eventually unlock cars to travel further into the Alaskan wasteland. Traveling is restricted to the amount of water the player carries. You'll be able to upgrade the amount of water carried and the travel speed to allow the player to explore further from their base. Beware though the further you go out the more dangerous it becomes. Player death will not be perma-death although as a game designer I do believe in some sort of punishment for death. The idea of loss makes the game more exciting and fun.  STORY:   999 years following the events of The UWN Superfluous' mission to save the earth the pieces of the asteroid in which the fabled ship destroyed crashed into Earth causing massive destruction and loss of life.  Many years later the remainder of humanity clings to life in the dry arid lands once known as Alaska. Radiation has caused mutations and mass extinctions. The large bipedal rhinos known as the Karkadann and the frog-like carnivore known as the Anura are both products of this mass mutation. A very tenuous peace between the three races are kept in check only by the limited resources each side controls. The humans have most of the knowledge to build and maintain the tools and machines to help extract water and energy. The Karkadann protect the only large known source of water and use it to produce the large quantities of vegetables their size requires (they are herbivores). The Anura have monopolized the salvage market; if you need anything ask an Anura. Being amphibious they can dive in the toxic oceans and bring back material and technology once thought lost.  More mysteries unravel as the land is plagued by a new threat. The dead are rising and seem to be controlled by the once recluse Inks (ink like creatures that take the form of humans and wear bones for decoration). Why have the Inks turned aggressive? Will the three tribes ban together to face the new threat or slowly be swallowed by it because they can't trust each other? Is llama racing really in the game?  This is a continuation of the story from my previous game "" The Superfluous "" also on itch.io  here . You will not have to have played my previous game to understand this one. If you did play it you might meet some familiar characters in your adventure though.  ROAD MAP:  Trello - Road Map  DEVELOPMENT  PLANS:  Alpha - Free  (always free here) Beta - half price (5.99$ ?)

"The world is at war. The Undead, the Goblins, the Karkadann, and the Humans have battle for centuries filling both heaven in hell with the souls of the dead. The divine powers have had enough and closed their doors, and in doing so have created Limbo. Hoping to create peace and bring the 4 races together in mutual cooperation, the powers of heaven created 4 keys, one given to each race, that if used together would create a gate back into the world of the living. A compassionate gesture, but for peoples born of war, a futile one. The war raged on limbo each side fighting to secure the keys from the other races, open the portal, and return with a massive army to the world. The humans in the world of the living used technology to fight the much stronger races, but here in limbo they have none. In Limbo, the humans were easily enslaved by the other races and forced to work, killed for pleasure, or used as food. The world of the living continued to fight unaware of the chaos that awaited them in the after-life. Then you died. You were a very shrewd. powerful, and tactful king. You won battles many thought destined for failure. Will you be the one to rescue your people in Limbo? Will you rally an army to win the freedom of your people? Will you fight to unify the 4 races or will you crush the races in Limbo and return with an army to end the war? Or will you fail and become just another goblin stew?

"The ultimate starship designer, powered by a deep game simulation...  Cosmoteer is a starship design, simulation, and battle game.  Design a fleet of ships by laying out individual rooms and corridors, including cannons, lasers, shields, and thrusters. Battle other starships to earn bounties and use that money to expand your own ship. A dynamic crew and combat simulation makes every design decision important and interesting.  Best-In-Class Starship Designer   Design the greatest starship ever made  using an interface that is easy-to-learn yet incredibly flexible.  Build your ship by placing individual modules  onto a grid—weapons, shields, engines, reactors, crew's quarters, and more! Few restrictions and no pre-defined, creativity-limiting hull shapes mean you can create almost any ship you can imagine.  The exterior of a ship is like an artist's canvas,  but it requires no drawing ability to make your ship look great! Simply pick a color and texture to customize your ship's basic appearance, then optionally add decals such as shapes, symbols, and letters to give it extra visual flourish. Painting your ship is free and has no effect on gameplay.  Intelligent Crew Simulation   Every starship is operated by a crew  numbering from half-a-dozen to hundreds—sometimes more than a thousand—of individually-simulated people.  A ship's crew is its lifeblood.  Crew not only operate its controls, but they also carry supplies such as ammunition and power batteries to weapons and systems. When a weapon wants to shoot, the crew go pick up ammo or batteries at an ammo factory or reactor and bring them to the weapon—all simulated in real-time.  Crew are pretty smart  and act mostly on their own, which is a good thing since there can be so many. Your crew are smart enough to figure out what controls need operating, what systems need ammo or power, and how best to get around your ship. They're even smart enough to avoid routes that are already jammed with other people.  The crew simulation is what makes starship design so interesting , because how fast a cannon can shoot or how long a shield can stay charged  depends directly on how quickly crew can deliver ammo or power to it . As a player, you'll have to think carefully about how you design your ship's layout so that it operates at peak efficiency without exposing its more vulnerable (and sometimes explosive!) modules.  Physics-Driven Flight & Combat   Every ship is part of a 2D physics simulation , and the position and orientation of its thrusters realistically affects its movement. Small ships with lots of thrusters are fast and nimble, while large ships with proportionally fewer thrusters are naturally slower and more difficult to maneuver.  Weapons obey the laws of the physics simulation.  Whether or not a cannon or laser hits an enemy depends not on a dice roll but upon the trajectory of the shot and the size and speed of the enemy.  Damage is tracked module-by-module , and each module can be individually targeted & destroyed. Some modules can explode, causing collateral damage to the surrounding modules, so you'll have to think carefully about where you place your reactors and munitions. Too close to the edge and they'll be exposed to enemy fire; too far and your weapons won't fire fast enough.  Ships can break apart  into multiple pieces when their connecting modules are destroyed. Usually this will be a crippling blow, but any piece that has a control room, power, and thrusters can continue to operate independently, potentially remaining a threat to the enemy.  Single-Player   You are a bounty hunter , traveling from sector to sector, hunting down renegade enemies and destroying them.  Earn money for every enemy vanquished . Use your income to repair and upgrade your own fleet, growing bigger and more powerful with every victory.  Explore a galaxy  in search of bigger and more powerful enemies. The galaxy will crumble before your almighty armada!  Or play in a creative sandbox mode  with unlimited credits if being a bounty hunter isn't your cup of Earl Grey—the only limit is your imagination! (And the power of your computer.)  Multiplayer   Battle your friends and enemies in real-time , pitting your designs against theirs. Compete to be the master ""Starship Architect & Commander"" against up to 7 other players in Team vs Team and Free For All battles.  Configure a variety of game options  by specifying number of ships, total funds, game speed, and other options. Play tiny skirmishes, massive fleet battles, or anywhere in between.  Play online  in public or private lobbies. Local Area Network and direct I.P. address connections are also supported.  Important Note:  Multiplayer is NOT SUPPORTED between 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems!  And more!   Everything you should expect from a PC game,  including customizable controls, windowed and borderless display modes, support for high-resolution displays, no mandatory locked framerates, and dozens of other options to tailor the game to your own preferences.  It's easy to share your ship designs  with friends and other players. Ships are saved as simple PNG image files and can be easily shared on social media like Twitter, Discord, and the official forums—just drag-and-drop the image from your browser right into Cosmoteer and the ship will be instantly playable!  A powerful modding framework  lets mods change almost any part of the game data, opening up a universe of possibilities beyond the base game. A mods manager makes it easy to install and uninstall mods created by the Cosmoteer community.   Unobtrusive tutorials  that don't interrupt gameplay and are easy to dismiss or turn off altogether. There's no special ""tutorial level"" you need to play through—the context-sensitive tips are built-in to the main Bounty Hunter mode.  Main Website  Forum  Chat (Discord)  Wiki Install instructions Simply download and run the installation program.  Some overly-aggressive anti-virus programs may incorrectly think Cosmoteer is a virus or prevent you from running the installer, merely because its's downloaded so infrequently.

"Frostfire is an abstract match-3 puzzle game combining both new and familiar mechanics to create deeper gameplay.  To reach a higher score you need to match three or more similar chips (of the same element, fire or frost, and the same level), merging them into a single chip of the next level. You can move a chip by tapping it and then tapping its destination, provided that there is an unblocked path between these two locations. There are six levels of chips; the higher the level of matched chips, the more points you get. Merging three or more chips of the highest level (of any element) produces the final unremovable chip - Frostfire.  Each new game is played on a randomly generated hexagonal board, making the game less repeatable and sometimes more difficult.  Music by Robert Dooley.

"How to play:  Traverse a number of dungeon levels to retrieve the Amulet of Yendor. To advance to the next level you need to discover and play the exit card. Some cards need a target to be played (e.g. drag a weapon card to an enemy card to attack that enemy with that weapon) and others do not (e.g. click an armor card to equip it). Hunger level increases every time you turn a card face-up or play the exit card. At the maximum hunger level these actions cause 1 point of damage to the hero. After turning a card face-up, attacking an enemy and playing the exit card all open enemies attack the hero. Amount of damage enemies inflict to the hero depends on the difference between the current dungeon level and the current character level (see the indicator at the top right corner of the window). You can attack an enemy without a weapon by simply clicking its card. Such attack inflicts 1 point of damage. You can ""lure"" an enemy to a revealed trap by dragging the enemy card to the trap card (or vice versa). An armor can be equipped only after ""exhausting"" a previously equipped one.

"In the winter of 1967, a young man enters out of the snowy night into a bar in the sleepy town of Cedar on the northern frontier of Maine. He takes off his gloves and rubs his hands together. He slips out a golden pocket watch from inside his coat, checks the time, and gently places it back. Closing his tired eyes, he stops to think.  He is a wanderer cursed with eternal youth, sent out by fate forever to roam the world, never to find a home. The bartender approaches him when he takes a seat and he pays for a drink so he can stay. The liquid in the glass shines slick like oil under the dim lights of the bar. Warmth fills the wanderer as he downs it in one gulp. After that he sits awhile to rest but knows he can't stay. Just as he gets up to leave, he notices something happening in the corner of the room. A girl in a green dress is about to sing.    This short, kinetic visual novel inspired by traditional folk music was created within the course of 2 weeks for the NaNoRenO 2016 visual novel development festival.

"Retroactive was created for the  Extra Credits Holiday 2018 Game Jam  using  Panda3D .  Announcements:  On the  7th of February  a  bugfix  version was made available. The update is so late because I needed to keep the game  exactly  the way it was made during the 3 days of the Jam. On the  14th of February   a special  Valentines version  was made available as a thank you to all the people who downloaded, played, shared, streamed, and featured on 'Games You Might Not Have Tried'     ❤️  The theme was Preset - this game takes a twist on presenting things. I don't want to spoil it for anyone but when You experience that 'Oh, Wow, so THAT was IT!' moment you'll know  that was it.  Also - there's a beachball in the game - if i have to explain you wouldn't understand.  As you can see from the screenshots it is strongly influenced by the '80 retro-futuristic style, Synthwave/Outrun and the old intro for Jonny Quest.  The game is short - but I can see myself turning it into something more. If You  feel like playing the game more - please leave a comment, or a dollar,  that would get me motivated. If You don't like it - I'd also like to hear why, don't be a stranger, leave a comment!

"Overview  Take control of a small team of contractors, hired by mysterious suits for impossible jobs against powerful corporations. Your contractors each have custom cybernetics that allow them to use a host of abilities, represented by cards. These cards are used in turn-based combat for actions such as movement, attacking, defending, and special abilities. Along with combat, you'll also encounter events, character upgrades, and black market shops as you explore each corporation. Add and remove cards from your decks to customize each character to your liking!  Features  It's called Power, not mana Playing cards costs Power, and the bad news is that each round your Power resets to zero. The good news is that each card can also be discarded to gain Power. Do you keep each character balanced and focus your Power on the character with the best hand each turn? Or do you make one of your characters into a recycler to fuel their killing machine companion?  Game-changing cybernetic upgrades Along with adding new cards to their decks, characters can also be modified through permanent Upgrades. Unlike cards, these Upgrades are always active and can greatly change how a character plays. Want to drain the life from your enemies every time they bleed? That can be arranged, at the cost of never healing through standard means again.  Unique character classes Each player character is represented by a different class, and each class has their own unique cards to build a deck from. The Soldier uses ranged attacks with his guns and shields to block incoming damage. The Ninja is limited to mostly melee attacks with their daggers, but can also move around the maps with ease to avoid enemy attacks entirely. Random-ish levels Hand-made environments and encounters are pieced together through procedural generation to build each unique level. Changing layouts, hazards, and events keep each run fresh, while enemy encounters and combat maps are designed for fun and challenge.",Strategy||Card Game,Cyberpunk||Pixel Art||Roguelike||Roguelite||Turn-Based Combat,Hostile Takeover,whisperingspider.itch.io/hostile-takeover

"You'll live a hundred lives in the Yondering Lands. You'll untangle human stories and fight mustering forces who threaten peaceful folks. You'll gather threads of beauty, magic, and strife to weave your own ever-growing legend, called Wildermyth.  * * *  An Imaginative Papercraft World  The Yondering Lands weaves hand-painted 2D characters and scenery into a 3D world to create a luscious, layered landscape, full of detail and surprises. No orcs, elves, or goblins here—but watch out for the telepathic insect-dragons and the clockwork undead.  Character Depth  Each of your heroes has their own unique generated history, personality, appearance, and relationships with the other heroes—all of which can change over the course of the game as they encounter mysteries and overcome challenges.  Choices That Matter  A hero may choose to trust the enigmatic wolf god, leading to a particularly hair-raising change in their appearance and combat abilities. Or they may choose whether to pursue a romance with a fellow hero, giving each of them new advantages from fighting side by side. Encounters and events have permanent, character-defining effects, letting you craft the arc of each character.  A New Approach to Death  Got one-shotted by that tentacled horror-bear? Choose to let a hero ""fall back"" with a maiming that can open up opportunities for transformation later, or let them go down in a blaze of glory to be remembered for generations to come.  Fresh Tactical Combat   Combat in Wildermyth emphasizes teamwork and careful positioning. Walling and flanking provide conflicting incentives, and  interfusion  lets you remake the battlefield with explosive magic. Multiple difficulty levels mean you can get as intense as you want to.  Endless Replayability  Procedural generation gives you new heroes, new enemies, new story events, and new maps every time you play. Pick and choose from a huge bank of combat abilities as your heroes level up in each playthrough, and decide whether you prefer offensive or defensive tactics, brute strength, stealth, or magically flinging fire from a nearby lamp into your enemies' faces.  Build a Legacy  As time passes, heroes grow old and may retire, or may fall in combat. Adding them to a roster of legends allows you to call on them in later playthroughs, creating a metagame as you build their mythology and increase the renown of your pantheon.

"A visual novel where Alice steps into a different kind of wonderland. 	In The Bottom of the Well, you play as Alice who has just had an unsettingly life-like dream about the end of the world. She retells her experience to her friend in a huge, branching narrative. Although a single play-through might take as little as 20 minutes, experiencing all the possible paths Alice can take through the ruins of her city will take you many hours. 	The game is intended to be replayed several times with different permutations of Alice: try playing as a survival-minded lone-wolf, or a social butterfly, or why not attempt the difficult but rewarding romantic route? The stats you select for your Alice in the beginning of the game influences everything from small comments to major choices. 	This is an updated, reworked and improved version of my entry to the 	 WAG (Write A Game) Challenge  arranged by IGDA's Game Writing SIG, where it placed first in the amateur category. The jury had this to say: 	- WINNER: THE BOTTOM OF THE WELL 	 	 The Bottom of The Well delivers an entertaining, branched story with interesting options. Alice's dream is genuinely terrifying. The conversations feel natural and appropriate. Players can randomize their character stats, but still negotiate the game with deliberate and meaningful choices. The final game stats give The Bottom of the Well immense replay value. One judge played the game several times to find the ""best"" ending!

"Version: 0.93 (Updated Beta)  Please notice this game is fully playable yet it is not complete. Several major updates are planned. They will massively change the game experience thus I invite you to re-play the game as soon as it is considered 'ready'.   Backstory  Elengrad  was once a dangerous land. Full of magic and monsters. Good King Borgar seeing people suffering and fighting hard for their lives decided to send his best warriors to destroy all the evil in the world. And it worked. The land became safe and people were living happily. Or so it seemed...       Good King Borgar died of age and so most of the brave warriors did. Short after that all evil returned. Sons of the ones that once defeated dark forces decided to travel the world and help poor, unprepared people.  And so did  Eric . This young, brave man decided to return to a small village he used to visit often in his childhood. What problems will he find there? What secrets will he discover?   Featured  Every video below contains MAJOR spoilers!

The combat will be more dynamic. This will be achieved by introducing minor variations between attacks (animations) and knock-back after the enemy is hit.        Map extension - this update will significantly increase the size of the map. This will enhance ""Metroidvania experience"". At this moment the map is quite linear and the player has no real chance to get 'lost'. Some secret area will be introduced.

"Do you like strategy games? Are you a regular human who still hasn't figured out how to move at the speed of light? Then oh boy is Bot Land the game for you!  In Bot Land, all of your bots follow  scripts  (so you can snap your controller in half for all we care). You'll tell your bots how to perform actions  ahead of time , that way they don't need a lousy human to control them mid-battle. This allows your bots to fight even while you're offline; they'll protect your CPU against other players' attacks.  Now, let's be honest... you're a great gamer—that's why you're reading this description—but even  you  might still lose a match or two. That's where replays come in handy. Maybe your opponent cloaked, bypassed your bots, and destroyed your CPU while your own bots were busy calculating prime numbers with a billion digits. You can use that information to improve for next time.  Then, after improving your defense, you can attack other players' CPUs in the same way. Maybe you've got a killer strategy involving  LANDMINES  or  TELEPORTATION  or  OTHER BOLDED WORDS , the likes of which no one has ever  seen  before. You finally find the perfect chump on which to unleash this onslaught. They've got measly bots with  artillery  and  shields , so you teleport behind them, misquote a meme, and punch them in their shiny metal backs. You're the top dog-bot now.  And when you win...? Oh, don't even get us started. You'll earn  Botcoin , which, through a myriad of steps, roughly translates to  fame and fortune  in real life (the steps are really just a sense of satisfaction and a profound feeling of ""the courage was within me the entire time!""; Botcoin isn't a cryptocurrency). You'll buy new items, make new strategies, teach a wasp bot how to love, ponder whether we're all just living in a simulation, and then look up how to remove wasp-bot stingers from your arm. It's great fun.  Features:   Fully automate battles—no APM needed  Create scripts visually (with Blockly) or via code  Test scripts before attacking other players  Learn through several tutorials  Play both sides of the battle: attacking and defending  Watch replays to improve your defense  Start revenge battles against players who’ve attacked you  Improve your ranking by winning matches  Customize your bots’ appearances—create any combination of head, torso, and foot items  Earn Botcoin through daily missions  Create an avatar to represent yourself to other players  Share your defense with other players with a direct link  All versions of Bot Land are compatible for cross-platform play",Strategy||Educational||Simulation,Automation||Multiplayer||Robots||Tactical||Tilemap based tools||Touch-Friendly,Bot Land,xtonomous.itch.io/bot-land

"Day in the Life of a Harpy is a short but sweet story of a harpy girl that was wandering out late and must get home before dinner. 	The game features moderately paced platforming, lighthearted visuals, and upbeat music. 	The main protagonist, Duri, has various skills that can help her fend off creatures that threaten her. Her main method of attack is to shoot feathers from her wings, but she has other methods, such as a bag that she can use to capture and throw enemies. She can use her wings to keep her in the air, though, being young, she can only flap them several times before she needs to rest on the ground again. 	This adventure takes the player through a variety of stages that are simplistic and fun in their own ways. Day in the Life of a Harpy is a short , but uplifting experience.",Platformer,2D||chiptune||Cute||Game Boy||GameMaker||lighthearted||monster-girls||Retro||Short||simple,Day in the Life of a Harpy,xysspon.itch.io/day-in-the-life-of-a-harpy
"Perfection... The you that we help shine through!  A first-person psychological horror game that taps into mankind's insecurities that we all share as human beings. This game will be personalised to each player by using back end data to keep a log of the players information as well as how they interact with the game world around them. This information will then change certain aspects of the game, making the experience more personalised and hopefully helping each person to realise aspects about their own personality. Data will be shown as a personality log at the end of the game for each person to see how the game judged them.  This is the result of a third year Computer Game Arts game, showcasing a bigger idea of using games and back-end data, including social media, to create an immersive and thrilling game. This game was made by  Yasmin Curren : Game Designer and Developer,  Tiffany Derbyshire : Environment Artist,  Tabitha Beresford-Owen : Character Artist,  @MerrellFacets : Character Artist and Jaime Aldous at  HoriZen Productions : Music Producer.

"BOG is a lil shared-screen stealth-combat game.  It's still a work in progress, and there are definitely some known bugs.  Hopefully I'm already working on any weirdness you notice, but please do get in touch if you have any feedback/issues, it's hugely appreciated.  Find me here: https://twitter.com/yannish or send a direct message here: ian at drydockgames dot com I'll be trying to track bugs and fixes  here . Thanks! System: BOG does well with a desktop-class CPU, but can run on laptops as well. It's still playable below 60fps but you can turn on a framerate toggle in the options to see if how you're doing. Try knocking the grass density down a little bit if it's slow.  Meanwhile I'll keep hacking away at the emerald mine of shader code knowledge to hopefully make it smoother for everybody. What you'll need to play: 2 relatively modern usb controllers to connect, and a friend to play with.  BOG's now using  InControl . You can see a list of the supported controller types  here .  Note some controllers require 3rd party drivers I can't vouch for. Be wary of the PS3 stuff on windows especially. :| How to play: X to slash. A to dash. A then X to strike. B to duck. Y to wiggle grass while you're ducked. You can hide in the grass while ducking, W iggle to find yourself, and try to spot the Wiggles of your opponent. Dashing into an opponent will Check them, and potentially knock them out of the arena. Slashing while Dashing will yield a Strike; a further-reaching and more focused attack.

Overview  JUMPALA is a fast-paced competitive game that's all about sabotage, superpowers, and stage control. While the core mechanics are simple, each game is a test of skill and strategy as you try to outscore and outplay your opponents.   Play with up to 4 players locally, or compete with others online.   Game Features  Compete against up to four of your friends in action-packed free for alls, or team up in 2v2 matches. Easy to learn, tough to master. But if you want to be the best, you'll have to plan your routes, practice your timing, and perfect your positioning—all while being mindful of your opponent. Choose from a variety of stages, each with unique features and hazards to watch out for Each character has their own unique abilities and playstyle. From attacking your opponents to racking up points—whatever your style, there's a character for you.   Characters   Lola has been training for the Jumpala Championship since the age of 17. She's a fierce competitor who will do whatever is necessary to win—even if that means slicing through the competition.  Special - Dash N' Slash Lola quickly moves and strikes with her sword, KOing any player standing on an adjacent platform. Ultimate - Line Strike Lola dashes across the stage, KOing all opponents between her current position and the end of the row.  Frore has earned a reputation for her elegance and relentlessness on the field. A two-time Jumpala champion and international celebrity, she now competes primarily for the sake of her fans. She uses her mastery of ice to slow opponents and get ahead.  Special - Ice Blast Frore will shoot an ice projectile that freezes players on contact. Frozen players aren't able to control platforms. Ultimate - Algific Defense Frore freezes all platforms that are her color. Frozen platforms must be jumped on three times before the ice breaks. Icy spikes will also appear briefly, freezing any player who touches them. Passive - Cold Resistance Frore stays frozen for 50% less time.  Cid is one of the youngest professional competitors in the history of Jumpala, and he feels like he has a lot to prove. The son of a renowned mechanic, he possesses a particular affinity to machines and gadgetry. The gauntlet on his arm, which he engineered himself, allows him to hack platforms to his advantage.  Special - Lock Cid will lock his current platform to his color, preventing any other player from changing its color. This ability will even override previously locked platforms! Ultimate - Row Lock Cid will send a shock wave that locks all platforms on his current row.  Bommer grew up doing demolition work with her father in the mineral caves. She's a thrill seeker—the only reason she joined the competition is that it's dangerous. She carries explosives to help spice things up a little.  Special - Lock Bommer places an explosive on her current platform that she can detonate at will. Ultimate - Row Lock Bommer destroys all the platforms that are her color, except the one that she's currently standing on.",Action||Fighting||Platformer||Strategy,Arcade||competitive||gamepad||Local multiplayer||Multiplayer||party-game||Pixel Art,Jumpala,yokereba.itch.io/jumpala

"(This is the original free student project. The fully complete Octodad: Dadliest Catch can be  purchased here .)  Octodad is a third person adventure game about destruction, deception, and fatherhood. The player controls Octodad, a dapper octopus masquerading as a human, as he goes about a day of his life. His existence is a constant struggle, as he must master mundane tasks with his unwieldy boneless tentacles while simultaneously keeping his cephalopodan nature a secret from his human family.   The player controls Octodad like a marionette, dragging his arms and legs around while his body flops along. The player’s goals are often simple household chores made difficult and interesting by the flailing, tenuous control they have over Octodad’s body.   Being an octopus also has its strengths. Octodad can slip through tight spaces, grab objects with his suckers, and knock things around with tremendous strength. But if the player does things too out-of-the-ordinary, Octodad’s family will grow suspicious and realize what he really is. If they do, it’s game over for Octodad!

"After abandoning her high-powered tech career and a mysterious three-year absence, Evelyn Ishino-Aubrey resurfaces working as a proxy for a virtual counseling app called Eliza. Her job consists solely of reading a script provided to her in real-time by an AI, leaving her no autonomy over what she says. Is Eliza a technological marvel that brings therapy to those who otherwise couldn’t access it? Or is it an ineffective replacement and another vector for technology companies to gain control over our lives and humanity?  As she reconnects with people from her past and gets to know the ordinary people of Seattle who use Eliza for counseling, Evelyn finds herself caught in the middle between differing sides of the argument— and as she begins to question everything about her past life and future purpose in the world, it becomes clear she must confront the turmoil and darkness inside.  A thought-provoking story told in the form of a visual novel from an award-winning indie team. Follow Evelyn’s journey through a present-day Seattle brought to life with beautiful hand-painted art. Get to know Eliza’s clients and the employees of Skandha, the technology giant behind it, with over a dozen fully-voiced characters and powerful performances from a highly regarded cast.

"Hedon - Episode One  - Freeware Version 1.2.0 - Full Commercial Version 1.5.2   Patreon (devblog & rewards)   |  Wiki  |  Twitter  |  Youtube  Permission is granted for the use of full video-audio footage from Hedon in order to stream, showcase or review it in any form.   Gameplay (Freeware)  Gameplay (Commercial)  Hedon mixes old school/boomercore elements with current gen design. This means:  ➣ Sprawling levels that offer a degree of freedom and don't hold the player's hand. Exploring, hunting secrets, backtracking, patience and having to figure out what to do next is key. Monsters and pickups are hand-placed and vary according to the difficulty you play on.  ➣ Original story packed with lots of lore and a focus on subtle details and world building, all doubled by a strong atmosphere.  ➣ Gory, fast paced shooting, a solid arsenal of weapons and magic items. Combat is projectile-based, movement is essential, enemies are unique and vary in type and abilities. There is no leveling up, no talent trees, no gradual upgrades - you are in full charge of your skill.  ➣ Original soundtrack ranging from tense to serene ambient, with occasional bursts of metal. Later in the game you will also hear some of Alexander Brandon's personal tracks that never released in Unreal and Deus Ex!  ➣ Thousands of hours of work put into an original concept, digitally hand-drawn graphics (textures, sprites, frame by frame animations etc.), scripting, sound effects and level design, all by a one man dev team aiming to create a game with a strong personality and feel.  ➣ Over eight hours of good old singleplayer action with five difficulties including Brutalizing, which changes the gameplay to allow interesting second playthroughs (different fights & pick-ups, companions etc.) and Bearzerk, which radically changes the combat by replacing guns with new melee weapons.  ➣ It's very light on storage (under 300mb) and well optimized for the GZDoom Engine.    Hedon is built upon elements of classic game design, most importantly the idea that the player needs to be treated with maturity by the game, which should never function as an automatic gratification machine, and require a degree of investment to be fully enjoyed.    You will be dropped in a hostile world that has its own workings, characters and intrigues, and you will be expected to fend for yourself. The build up is slow and steady, the story is simple but consistent, the combat is fast paced and ruthless. You will sometimes find yourself lost in a non linear level design with various aesthetics (forest, caves, forge, barracks, snowy mountain etc.) where exploration and learning by yourself is the key to improve.  You may find that Hedon takes a certain amount of atmosphere, gameplay, color and inspiration from games such as Unreal, Blood, Thief, Arx Fatalis, Serious Sam etc. but nonetheless aims to be original at all times.   You play as Zan, a half Orc - half Demon warrior who wakes up in a caved in tunnel after a convoluted hellish vision, with no memory of how she ended up there. The first episode will focus on our hero's descent into a strange underground world which is threatened by the sudden attack of a massive Cultist force. There are certain races and factions populating the world of Hedon.   The Iron Division A faction of amazon-like Orcs and Goblins, the Iron Division are the keepers Hedon's greatest secret - the crystal technology. Various magical crystals sprawl across the underground, providing energy, heat, oxygen and often forming entire biomes around them. Combining this power with crafting and the ancient art of magic, the Iron Division has founded a whole new civilization within their mountain stronghold known as Valc.  The Cultists Fallen to sin, the raving husks of what were once human now worship various figures of the Underworld. Little can be done to cull their addiction to pain and suffering. Little but a spray of frag fire or an explosive bolt that is...  The Demons Chaotic Demons dwell in the deepest parts of Hedon, lashing out at the weaker minds of the inhabitants of the Overworld. Along the ages, they have subdued entire towns to become their cultist slaves and feed their endless hunger through pain and suffering. Demons only care about feeding, and they will stop at nothing to do so.  The Earthborn Ancient dwellers of the underground, Minotaurs and Dwarves have built their own civilizations, ever clenched in warfare with the Demons spawning from below. However, their great cities and heritage were lost hundreds of years after their inevitable defeat in front of Hell's armies, and now they have been scattered and forced to live in small clans and towns.    Akhzul  - Hedon's OST dedicated composer. A one guitar man band.  Alexander Brandon  - The man himself. I bought few licenses for some of his personal tracks (and other songs that didn't make it in Deus Ex/Unreal) and fit them into Hedon!  Breathelast  - A band of underground sharks who pitched in with instrumental tracks of their songs. Also one of my favorite bands ever.  Methadone Skies  - Another solid band from the underground, guilty of creating dreamlike musical atmosphere.

"Ebony Spire: Heresy  is a love letter to  dungeon crawlers  of old with a twist: It's been signed with the blood of many roguelike games that have been experienced by the writer. Crawl, throw, summon and smash your way through 20 levels of pure mishap in this first person turn based dungeon crawling game. Experience a back-to-the-basics computer role playing game where items play a central role. Pick up, throw, use, equip and drink your way up the tower to slay the fervent goddess.  Items range from equippable swords and armors to drinkable potions and artifacts that can summon, teleport or annihilate your enemies. Trinkets can be wield to increase your stats and everything can be thrown around to trigger their effects or just crush your opponents underneath their weight.

WHY YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE THIS GAME  Ebony Spire: Heresy  is a niche game that blends roguelike mechanics with old-school first person dungeon crawlers. The game is designed as a coffee-break game (short play sessions) and may be a deal-breaker for some players while others might enjoy the quick level-to-level progression while they are queueing in an online game.

And since the code is easily accessible you can mod it, add items, enemies and levels to your hearts content.

This allows for an extreme amount of replayability since no world has the same characteristics as the previous one, this combined with the beautiful low-poly look of the world makes exploring an enjoyable part of the game.   Classes & Skill Trees  Build your own character, choose to be a mage, warrior, an archer or a rogue. Level up to learn new skills and discover different ways of playing. Each class can specialize into other subclasses, providing unique skills and different gameplay styles.   Items & Crafting  Find and collect over 100+ unique items. Gather raw materials and use them to craft more complex items that will help you in your journey through the world.   Generated Quests  Quests are scattered around the world and depend on the environment, allowing for extreme replayability. Complete them and obtain great rewards which will help you progress further.  https://discord.gg/AEC4Uab  https://www.reddit.com/r/projecthedra",Adventure,3D||Action-Adventure||Action RPG||Exploration||Low-poly||Open World||Procedural Generation||Roguelike||Singleplayer||Third Person,Project Hedra,zaphyk.itch.io/project-hedra

"Marooned in an alien, airless wasteland — your starship fractured — your crewmates missing. Can an apprentice alchemist learn how to survive? 	 Hadean Lands  is interactive fiction — a classic text adventure. No graphics! No dialogue trees! No point-and-click! You type your commands, and read what happens next. 	 Hadean Lands  is a game of alchemy and exploration, with an intricate structure of interlinked puzzles. Every ritual you learn adds a new ability to your toolkit. But every ritual requires a different combination of ingredients, and some ingredients are in desperately short supply. The game's sophisticated goal-tracking system permits you to experiment freely! Any ritual you've learned can be performed with a single command. Any puzzle that you've ever solved can be re-solved automatically. Click on the in-game map to travel to any room you're familiar with; the goal system will even find known keys and re-solve intermediate puzzles to get there. But beware: many puzzles have multiple solutions. If the ones you've found don't fit together, you may have to go searching for alternatives... 	 Repairing an alchemical starship single-handed? Not easy; perhaps impossible. You'll have to discover the rituals you need, and then search for ingredients, and then improvise and substitute. You'll have to calcine, distill, dissolve, and precipitate. And somehow, somewhere, you'll have to figure out what happened and why.  	 Winner of the  XYZZY Interactive Fiction Awards  for Best Puzzles, Best Setting, Best Implementation, and Best Use of Innovation for 2014.  	Not familiar with interactive fiction?

"Plot: The small town of Foxwood receives unwanted attention as the death of three girls becomes the focal point and the talk of the town. Daisy Winters, Rose Summers, and Leslie Falls die two days before their high school graduation in an alleged suicide pact. Quinn, a private investigator, takes on the case to figure out how the girls died. Missing evidence and an incompetent police department hinders his investigation until he comes across a diary belonging to one of the victims. The diary sheds light on the town's troubled past and why the town is covering up the deaths. Description: Sins Of Daisy is an episodic crime drama that will span four episodes. Each episode will have two different endings based on the choices and decisions you make in the game. These choices will carry over from the previous episode to the next episode. If you love shows like Twin Peaks, The Killing, Law And Order or True Detective you will love this type of game. Game Play Features: Multiple Endings Horror Comedy Story Rich Unique Characters Main Characters: Quinn - The protagonist of the series. He is a foul-mouthed and egotistical individual with little regard for others. Reluctant at first, Quinn takes a huge interest in the case of the three girls. Birch - The police chief of Foxwood. The tenacious chief only wants to protect his town and is willing to bend the rules to keep his town safe. Suspicious of how the girls died coupled with an inconclusive coroner report, Birch joins Quinn in their quest to solve this mystery. Daisy Winters - The most popular girl at school. Everyone in Foxwood knows who Daisy is or should I say use to know. She was found dead in her bedroom two days before graduation.

She despises the Foxwood Police Department and rebuffs any notion that her friends committed suicide. Fed up with the case; she decides to take the law into her own hands. Detective Williams - A moronic detective employed by the Foxwood Police Department. Somewhat of an idiot; he does have redeeming qualities such as his loyalty to Birch. Detective Isaac - A hard-nosed in your face detective working for the Foxwood Police Department. He has an old school mentality and believes that unnecessary force is just a myth. Detective Rourke - The only female detective in the Foxwood Police Department. She is mentally unstable at times and has a strong belief in the ""blue wall of silence"".

"Max Massacre is a Visual Novel with a single choice to determine the ending.   In a world filled with monsters, demons, and other inhuman creatures, mankind is no longer the dominant race. Humans are nothing more than cattle, fed on by more powerful entities and hunted down for sport. Humans in general are weak, not even a match for the children of those who hunt them, and they know it. The human race is steadily declining, and before long, mankind will exist no longer.  As a child born into such a world, Max aspires to become a hero. A mighty warrior who will save the human race from the cusp of extinction, wielding strength unheard of for a boy on the brink of adulthood. He is already the strongest fighter in his village in hand to hand combat, and he has killed his fair share of low-level monsters. At seventeen years of age, he is well on his way to becoming the hero he aspires to be, and no matter how much his fellow villagers hate and scorn him for his demonic aura, Max wishes to save every one of them.  Forever by Max's side is his childhood friend and love interest, Celeste. Like Max, she possesses incredible strength, and is by far the strongest sorceress in the village. She is knowledgeable, intelligent, well-liked, and quite attractive; a truly fortunate young woman in almost every way imaginable. However, beneath this amiable exterior is a mind far more cynical and unforgiving. She does not share Max's outlook on life, nor does she condone his desire to become a hero, or to protect those who harm him. To her, humans are no better than the demons oppressing them, and she would happily leave their village in flames, if only Max would go with her.  As Max and Celeste go about their routine lives in the small village they call home, their differing views on the world clash every day, with each one trying to convince the other to see the light. But with the other villagers all living in fear and contempt of Max, and not hesitating for a moment to show how they feel, Celeste has a clear advantage. She believes it's only a matter of time before Max realizes what a fool he has been, and with the level of malice being directed towards Max increasing day by day, she might be right.  Will Max manage to convince Celeste that the human race is worth protecting? Or will Celeste prove to Max once and for all that his enemy is not demonkind, but the familiar faces of those who deny his humanity?",Visual Novel,Anime||Fantasy||Romance,Max Massacre,zetsuboushita.itch.io/max-massacre

"Yume Nikki 3d   is a fan game based on   Yume Nikki  universe (if you haven't played the original Yume Nikki, I highly recommend it). The game is not a simple 3d remake, but rather a spin-off to the original, with lots of extra content. Instead of using RPG Maker, I used an old 3d engine from the 90's.  The package also includes  Isolated DLC . Only play this DLC after you've completed the main game. Note that  it's not necessary to be a fan of the original game  to enjoy YN3D. The concept is understandable and it's easy to pick up and play.  You play as a little girl Madotsuki. The game starts in your room. You can use the bed to enter the dream world or desk to save your game. The bed can transport you into a dream world where the majority of the game takes place, and your task is to find six ""effects"" and three keys in this world. Some of the effects are requied to progress in few areas of the game. The most important effects, such as bicycle and the knife, are hidden in the locations connected to Nexus (the hub location).  Most locations in Dream world are connected by series of portals and there's no boundaries . You are free to explore the game world.

"A game that takes place in space where you need to farm your way to survival. You must fully upgrade your spaceship if you want to succeed. Though beware, you might run of oxygen or ever worse, you could forget to turn off the water filter!  You have 4 types of plants: Metal, Oxygen, Crystal and Energy, which all have a specific purpose to your survival. If you want to upgrade your spaceship you need to farm metals and crystals which need to be processed by their respective machine that need to be power by Energy.  On the other hand, Oxygen and Water decrease over time, therefore you will need to replenish the supplies to avoid certain death.   The seeds to these plants can be acquired through the dispenser where the button will change the type of seed that can be acquired.  The Oxygen and Energy plants must be put in the transporter to be accounted for while the Crystal and Metal need to be processed.    Facts : You can only carry one item at a time and sometimes you will run out of power while holding a plant, sadly, you need to throw it in the trash.
